          Of all the prayers to the great and glorious master of Oddiyana,
          embodiment of all Buddhas past, present, and to come, the invocation
          composed of seven vajra verses is supreme.

          There is no need to get bogged down in the complexities of the kyerim
          and things like that which we don't really understand. Simply doing
          this practice [the Seven-Line Prayer] alone is sufficient.

          In the future during the darkest of times—although there exists a
          great variety of beneficent buddhas and deities—invoking me, Orgyen
          Padma Jungne, will bring the greatest benefit

        <h2>
          Why we are joining together to recite 21,000,000,000 and why this
          invocation is so powerful:
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Seven-Line Prayer, an invocation of the Indian Mahasiddha named
          Padmasambhava—also often referred to as Guru Rinpoche, "Precious Guru"
          and known as the Second Buddha—is not merely a prayer. It also
          functions as a method to awaken one's own primordial wisdom-mind
          according to the profound path of Ati Yoga. Although Padmasambhava is
          a historical figure who's known for establishing the Dharma in the
          land of Tibet, removing all obstacles and training his heart
          disciples; it's also understood that he achieved a miraculous state
          beyond death through which he can spontaneously benefit all those who
          address him with heartfelt devotion. The Seven-Line Prayer is
          universally known as the best means with which to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          One special revealer of Padmasambhava's hidden treasure teachings in
          the 20th century, widely considered to be both his emanation and
          regent, was Kyabje Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje Rinpoche (1904-1987).
          Dudjom Rinpoche's own son, heart disciple and lineage heir known as
          Dungse Shenphen Dawa Norbu Rinpoche, in the years prior to his
          Mahaparinirvana in 2018, often repeated this heartfelt advice to many
          of his disciples:
        </p>
        <S.EmphasizedParagraph>
          The most important activity to help dispel imminent global obstacles
          to peace and harmony, as well as environmental problems, disease and
          instability, is to recite and accumulate the Seven-Line Prayer.
        </S.EmphasizedParagraph>
        <p>
          At the time when Rinpoche last spoke of this in early 2018, he
          increased the number he felt would be able to shift our world's
          destructive course from one billion recitations to twenty one billion
          (21,000,000,000). The implication was that the negative potentials had
          gained so much momentum that it would require this immense number to
          turn the tide. Clearly this will require a global effort!
        </p>
        <p>
          Since up until now there has not been enough of an outreach, the
          current count is at almost 10 million. Although there is still a long
          way to go to achieve 21 billion, if everyone joins in with joyful
          diligence it is certain that we can accomplish our goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each person who joins a vast collective accumulation like this—no
          matter the amount they contribute—gathers the same merit as if they
          had achieved the total on their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          So let's use this time when millions of us in many countries are
          forced to stay at home wisely, to progress in this accumulation for
          our own protection and for everyone's benefit. And please share this
          website as widely as possible.

          If you really recite this prayer from your heart, then there's no way
          that you can avoid bringing Guru Rinpoche forth and invoking him. So
          it's extremely powerful. And you should practice it at all times
          continually. . . If you really focus on the Seven-Line Prayer, then it
          is certain that the blessings will come. The blessings of Guru
          Rinpoche will spring out and be born in your mind stream.

            A sacred terma statue of Guru Rinpoche known as Guru Dewa Chenpo,
            said to liberate one upon seeing it. This was one of the most
            precious items kept by Kyabje Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje Rinpoche,
            who would often sit in meditation with it. While he meditated with
            it, it would shed tears of amrita.
