          Extract of His Holiness' teaching on Guru Pema Tr√∂tengsel Paris 1984:

          ...Then we come to the invocation prayer known as "The Seven-Line
          Prayer", because it has seven lines.
        </p>
        <p>
          This prayer appears a lot and will come again and again as an
          invocation. The reason why this prayer comes so often is because at
          the very moment Guru Rinpoche was conceived, in a lake in the
          North-West corner of Uddiyana, realization was achieved
          simultaneously. When this happened many millions upon millions of
          dakinis sang this praise in one voice as a praise to the Lotus-born
          Guru. These dakinis sang from three most sacred places. Therefore, it
          has great blessings.
        </p>
        <p>
          To go just briefly through these lines, it says that: 'being born in
          the North-West corner of the country of Uddiyana, in a heart-center of
          a lotus, endowed with the most marvelous attainments, you are known as
          The Lotus-Born Guru, surrounded by many hosts of dakinis countless in
          number, I will follow in your footsteps'. This is basically what it
          means.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Seven-Line Prayer should not be considered as just another
          supplication or invocation prayer. Instead it should be understood to
          be the principle prayer calling for Guru Rinpoche which itself carries
          tremendous blessings. Due to the power of the essence of this prayer
          and the blessings it holds, when you have obstacles or hindrances, if
          you recite it with confidence 100,000 times, normally these can be
          immediately removed. Moreover, when I was young, I did this practice
          several times and found that you can do 10,000 recitations a day,
          which means that you can complete 100,000 recitations in ten days.
          Since countless millions of dakinis have uttered this profound prayer
          it has remarkable blessings. So, we should consider this not only as
          an invocation but also a means to bring about the essential blessings
          of Guru Rinpoche himself.

          My own root-teacher Gyurme Nyedun Wangpo, (otherwise known as, Podpong
          Tulku or Zapong Tulku because he was coming from Za region), would
          give this Seven-Line Prayer practice to all his students and disciples
          to do. He would even give it to the mothers and children. Whoever came
          to him to ask for teachings, he would simply say: "Just recite this
          and have devotion while reciting this prayer. Recite this, that is
          enough". Therefore, my own root-teacher himself essentialized all
          practice down to this Seven-Line Prayer. So, there is no need to get
          bogged down in the complexities of the kyerim and things like that
          which we don't really understand. Simply doing this practice alone is
          sufficient.
