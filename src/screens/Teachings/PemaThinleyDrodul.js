            Among the many different prayers to Guru Rinpoche, one begins with
            “Dusum Sangye Guru Rinpoche”. When this text says Dusum, it means of
            the three different times—past, future and present—the teacher of
            all of these three times is Guru Rinpoche. This shows that every
            single Buddha throughout all of these three times is included within
            Guru Rinpoche. So reciting Guru Rinpoche's mantra, the Seven Line
            Prayer, and any kind of practice on Guru Rinpoche is so important.
            And the Seven Line Prayer is especially important, as in so many
            different termas (treasure revelations) every terma contains these
            same lines. Although there are a great variety of terma practices
            and sadhanas based on Guru Rinpoche with many different forms and
            aspects, in all of them the Seven Line Prayer remains the same. That
            is a sign of how fundamentally important this Seven Line Prayer is.
            There are many different explanations of the Seven Line Prayer in
            these termas, and there are so many ways it can be understood. And
            so, in a sense, we can consider this Seven Line Prayer as the mother
            of all the terma texts. So chanting this Seven Line Prayer is so
            important, so powerful, and it can remove obstacles. In the world
            these days there are so many obstacles, particularly arising from
            the five poisons (the five negative emotions). These five poisons
            nowadays have been getting worse and worse in the world, and so this
            dark time has come over us. By this I mean simply that these poisons
            have gotten thicker, and heavier, producing this challenging
            experience of a dark time. For example we can see these days in the
            world that everyone is in competition, wanting to win, causing many
            people to wage war, which shows powerful pride: just one of the five
            poisons. So if we can focus on practicing the Seven Line Prayer and
            accumulating it, it is so, so, so very beneficial for this world.
            This is my real inner feeling that I want to share with you, that it
            is so very important to accumulate the Seven Line Prayer. And it's
            not only my vision, or my thought, it is said all the time in the
            texts, the termas, it was expressed by Yeshe Tsogyal herself, by so
            many tertons who have come since, by many high Lamas, all
            emphasizing how important this Seven Line Prayer is. So I wanted to
            humbly share my own inner feelings of faith and encouragement.
