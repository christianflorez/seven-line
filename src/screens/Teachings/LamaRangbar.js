          <p>The Seven Line Invocation of Guru Rinpoche</p>
          <p>An Elixir of Immortality From Enlightened Intent </p>

          Although there is no ultimately stabilized maturity in my continuum
          that I can extol as out of the ordinary, due to a sincere request, I
          will offer a fraction of an explanation of the basic functions of the
          Seven Line prayer from my experience for those wishing to extract
          themselves from confused and cyclic modes of being.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin with, this ordinary mind is continuously distracted from the
          appearance of its own fundamental pure ground. How does this happen
          you may ask. Although there is not one iota of truth in the arising of
          phenomenon as a separated multiplicity, mind seizes upon appearances
          coloring them with the tainted lens of wants, rejections and
          bewilderment while fortifying these erroneous beliefs with labels. As
          if these self-inflicted distractions were not already a significant
          challenge to overcome, other beings also trapped by their own
          individuated grasping onto perceptions work to assure the reification
          of false appearances of our dualistic assignments so they feel
          justified in holding onto their delusions.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result of the ripening of the excellent fortune first set in
          motion by Lord Buddha the Rishi of the Shakya clan, combined with the
          needs of sentient beings to completely transcend the endless pain of
          sustained delusion, upon the passing of Lord Buddha Shakyamuni,
          Amitabha Buddha emanated a heart-ray resplendent with wisdom lights
          which penetrated through the total resonance of the Samboghakaya,
          which took form as the arising of the miraculous form we have come to
          call, Padmasambhava the Lotus Born Guru. The miraculous nature of his
          birth itself is indicative proof of his purity and transcendence from
          error in any and all senses.
        </p>
        <p>
          This great being understood the infallible nature of that which
          appeared to be born of cause and that which was beyond cause and
          condition. Because of the unobstructed continuum he was manifesting
          then and now, he was not bound by localized intellectual constructs
          such as time and space or self-infatuated refence points. Guru
          Rinpoche understood perfectly how to assist beings trapped by their
          own immersion in confusion and as a result of this ability generated
          countless methods that could be applied by limitless migrators in
          Samsara. It is also due to this, that Guru Rinpcohe’s ability to read
          clairvoyantly through the three times and ten directions gave rise to
          numerous predictions and powerful methods which continue to arise as
          precise medicines for our world’s ills today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even during his own historic time, being flawlessly adept at
          navigating through the illusory appearances of obstacles and the like,
          he composed and gave rise to several prayers designed to invoke his
          unfathomable blessing stream without reference to time and space.
          Probably the most important and essentialized example of this is the
          Seven Line Prayer or invocation of Guru Rinpoche brought forth by the
          Dakinis themselves. The history of the initial appearance, use and
          detailed meaning of this prayer are available elsewhere in great
          detail in texts by several great Treasure revealers such as Karma
          Lingpa, Chogyur Lingpa and a host of others. For me to try to
          elaborate on these points would be like a child pointing into the sky
          and explaining where the light of the sun comes from and so I wish not
          to make a fool of myself when such accurate and pure material is so
          readily accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead I intend to share what I have gathered within the practice of
          plowing of my own field of experiences born from following the
          instructions of many revered holy masters of our Ancient Lineage.
        </p>

          Whereas it was previously thought to be exclusively a matter of
          science fiction, many of us now speculate that time travel may one day
          be possible. The warp and weft of space and time’s fabric is now a
          common topic among the world’s living leaders in the field of physics.
          Although we may not yet be able to step into a small wooden box with
          dials and buttons and arrive in the past or future, there is now deep
          suspicion that it might in fact be possible on some level. For us
          faithful followers of Guru Padmasambhava, this is in fact a basic
          underlying principle of our daily practice of Guru Yoga.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the recitation of the Seven Line Prayer and utterance of Guru
          Padmasambhava’s mantra, the false constructs of delusions can be
          instantaneously or at least gradually eradicated. In the common
          language of both the general public and Buddhist practitioners alike,
          the Seven Lines we are talking about are called “The Seven Line Prayer
          to Guru Rinpoche” and his mantra are often referred to as “The Mantra
          of Guru Rinpoche” and so on. In fact, if understood properly, the
          Seven Line Invocation to the Guru when uttered by a practitioner with
          ordinary awareness and devotion, is in fact Guru Rinpoche himself
          inseparable from its utterance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of this, this prayer, invocation or miraculous formula,
          however you may wish to label it, is none other than a clear and
          direct opening of the Heart-Mind of the Guru’s spontaneous presence of
          wisdom awareness and function of unobstructed compassion
          simultaneously. Considered by wise people to be the condensed essence
          of all Tantras and Mantras rolled into one prayer, a single utterance
          of the seven line invocation is minimally the equivalent of giving
          rise to Guru Rinpoche himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this view of the prayer can be maintained even sporadically
          throughout any given practice session, the blessing stream is manifest
          without regard to any other obstructing or contributing factors. In
          simple terms, even if one only had mediocre faith in the recitation of
          the Seven Line Prayer, the positive downpour of blessings are
          unstoppable. It is this unique power of this all-pervasive template of
          complete enlightenment that makes it so appropriate for the challenges
          we now face on all levels, outer, inner and secret.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Seven Line Prayer, is the one panacea, simple and easy to
          practice, which curtails the need for other elaborated practices while
          having the power to illuminate any darkness of the mind. It is
          difficult to think of any single more powerful antidotes to the deep
          sense of angst we are all experiencing these days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its radiant utterance purifies all corrupt and untruthful speech and
          overpowers conceited misleading speech. The wake of its instantaneous
          ripening causes ordinary appearances of suffering to arise as wisdom
          nectar and clears away the causes for future rebirths in confused
          existences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having been requested by a close Dharma brother, Daniel S., to say
          some words about the importance of reciting this prayer, these words
          are the form of my response. Moreover, based on the conditions we find
          ourselves coping with today and the advice of my own Guru, His
          Holiness Dungse Shenphen Dawa Rinpoche, I can safely say that the time
          to focus on such accumulations is squarely upon us. Regardless of if
          you adapt accumulations of the Seven Line Prayer exclusively or as a
          portion of your daily practice, or if you recite to benefit yourself,
          to benefit others or both; and regardless of my words being perfect or
          imperfect, such efforts will yield fruits beyond any other activity I
          can imagine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although such unfathomable declarations about the benefits of this
          prayer normally belong to the domain of realized masters, it is the
          ripening of my Guru’s blessings combined with unbending faith in Guru
          Rinpoche that allows me or even compels me to dare to make such
          proclamations. If I have offended any scholars or highly educated
          intellectual people, I apologize in advance for my child-like
          presentation of my delusions. Any error within my impure human speech
          are all my own, whereas any merit that may arise or has arisen from
          reading this, I dedicate to the transformation of all beings into the
          complete manifest display of the Guru’s fully ripened Four Kayas of
          Body, Speech, Mind, Qualities and Spontaneous Miraculous Activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was written by an uneducated child of the Guru parroting the
          sentiments of those with actual realization. May benefit be realized
          somewhere and everywhere.
