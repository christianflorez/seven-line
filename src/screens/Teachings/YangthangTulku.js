          Teachings on the Seven Line Prayer Yangthang Tulku Translated by

        <p>Prayers for teachings. Then Rinpoche speaks.</p>
        <p>Now I have to turn that wheel of dharma.</p>
        <p>
          So you want to hear an explanation on the Seven Line Prayer, otherwise
          known as the Invitation to Guru Rinpoche. Sometimes it is called the
          Seven Line Prayer and sometimes it is called the Seven Line
          Invitation. And, as you know, this is because there are seven lines of
          verse. And so this is a supplication, a prayer to Guru Rinpoche, an
          invitation bringing forth, inviting Guru Rinpoche. And so really in
          terms of a very good, extensive explanation on this, I do not have one
          to give. But Mipham Rinpoche himself composed a very extensive
          commentary on the Seven Line Prayer &mdash; 50 pages of outer, inner,
          secret, and super-secret explanations from the point of these four
          levels or sections. He gives a very detailed commentary on the inner
          meaning of the Seven Line Prayer from these four different levels of
          understanding. But for us now with me here, I will not be able to give
          you an explanation tantamount to that in the short amount of time we
          have. And even if we had the text here, maybe I&rsquo;d be able to
          read through the text and go over it with you. But if you really want
          an extensive commentary, then my mouth probably wouldn&rsquo;t be able
          to do all the talking for this one day. But I will speak a little bit
          about it in any case. And so please, all of you, listen with a pure
          and genuine intention of bodhicitta.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so the Seven Line Invitation then is the very same prayer that in
          the celestial pure lands, khach&ouml;, celestial pure lands of the
          dakinis... Then the mamos and dakinis, when they gather on the holy
          days, like Guru Rinpoche Day, which is the tenth lunar day, or the
          twenty-fifth day... and then perform tsok. They offer a ganachakra
          feast together. And it is this verse that they use to summon Guru
          Rinpoche to invite him to the feast. But Guru Rinpoche doesn&rsquo;t
          have to come and go like an ordinary person. However, spontaneously
          and naturally he makes his presence known. So he actually appears
          there in the context and the presence of the feast when the dakinis
          and mamos are then reciting this Seven Line Invitation, this
          supplication to Guru Rinpoche. And so this is called the Vajra Seven
          Lines because it is recited by the dakinis. This is the same verse
          that they use to invite Guru Rinpoche to come to their feast offering.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so then the dakinis will sing. They will chant this prayer to a
          very powerful and moving melody, beautiful melody. And then with this
          they will invite Guru Rinpoche. And so in the same way then for us
          then on the tenth day, the twenty-fifth day, the holy days, and also
          at any time and in any situation, whenever we recite the Seven Line
          Prayer to a beautiful sound and melody with single- pointed faith and
          devotion in Guru Rinpoche, then when we do this, Guru Rinpoche
          actually does come. He actually appears. Whether or not we&rsquo;re
          reciting it together in the context of a ganachakra, a tsok offering,
          or whether it&rsquo;s our general regular ongoing prayer... whenever
          and at any time that you recite the Seven Line Prayer, you are
          actually invoking Guru Rinpoche. And if you do so with faith and
          devotion, single-pointed, Guru Rinpoche does in fact actually appear.
          But because of our impure perception, we may not be able to sense it.
          We cannot see him with our ordinary eyes. So some people may be
          likened to think that maybe he doesn&rsquo;t really come because you
          can&rsquo;t see him. But it isn&rsquo;t like that. He does come.
          Whether or not we see him or not depends upon our level of our view,
          our pure view or not. Because some people may not recognize... they
          may not know that he&rsquo;s actually appearing there because they are
          still seeped in the impure view or impure perception. We cannot see
          him with our regular eyes, but he does in fact really come.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so also in India a long, long time ago there were two major
          institutes or temples of learning for Buddhist studies, which were
          extremely prestigious and filled with incredible scholars and masters,
          incredible panditas. And then there came a time at the one temple, one
          of the main temples, in which most of the more skilled scholars and
          panditas had faded away and there were only a few remaining. And then
          they began to be under siege or under threat of the non-Buddhist...
          kind of rival groups who belonged to different traditions. And there
          were the heretic groups who wished to, by means of debate, win over
          the institute and take it over under the context of their rule. And so
          they challenged the Buddhist panditas left in this institute to a
          debate. And because these were great scholars, great masters, they
          didn&rsquo;t really know how to respond. Because they knew that if
          they didn&rsquo;t respond with the greatest answer and they
          weren&rsquo;t really up to par, then... They were these great masters.
          How could they allow themselves to be defeated?
        </p>
        <p>
          And so being under this kind of situation, all of the panditas one
          night were visited by a wisdom dakini who came to them and said to
          each one, &ldquo;Well, it is true that if you try it on your own you
          will not be able to defeat these heretical groups merely on your own
          abilities. You will not be able to defeat them. They will defeat you
          in debate. And so if you want to defeat them and save your institute,
          then you must invite Guru Rinpoche from the pure land to come and help
          you.&rdquo; And so she explained to them how to do this.
        </p>
        <p>
          So they went to the top of the roof of their institute, the temple,
          the university. And there they arranged a vast and extensive offering
          of tsok, a feast offering. And then they all sang single- pointedly to
          a haunting melody almost like with one voice, in unison calling Guru
          Rinpoche with the Seven Line Prayer that the wisdom dakini told them
          to recite. And so then here they were sitting on the roof gathered
          together inviting Guru Rinpoche with the Seven Line Prayer, playing
          the cymbals with the incense lit and with the haunting, beautiful
          melody in one single voice, in unison. And Guru Rinpoche did actually
          appear there. He actually came. And when he came, then he went ahead
          and helped them. He defeated all of the heretic groups. And so he was
          able to annihilate their argument. And so then because of this then
          the panditas were able to win the debate and thus save their
          institute.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so the prayer begins &ldquo;HUNG Orgyen yul-gyi nup-jang
          tsam.&rdquo; And so HUNG, as you know, is a seed syllable, a heart
          seed life force or enlightened mind seed syllable. You see this a lot
          in the beginning of mantras &mdash; HUNG or HRI, these seed syllable
          letters. So whatever kind of yidam deity you are practicing or
          whatever you are practicing out of the three roots, usually the seed
          syllable of these deities or the guru is either HUNG or HRI, and so
          forth. So HUNG is like the seed syllable, which is like the life force
          or the seed syllable of the enlightened mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          So then &ldquo;Orgyen yul gyi nupjam tsam&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;On the
          northwest border of the country of Orgyen.&rdquo; Orgyen is Uddiyana,
          and I wouldn&rsquo;t know because I haven&rsquo;t actually been there
          (I&rsquo;ve seen it), except that it&rsquo;s supposedly actually
          traced back to Pakistan somewhere. I haven&rsquo;t been to Pakistan so
          I can&rsquo;t verify that. But in any case Pakistan seems to be the
          general area where Uddiyana is said to have originated and it is also
          the place of King Indrabodhi, who was actually the one who came and
        </p>
        <p>
          brought Guru Rinpoche when he found him there self-arisen in this
          lotus flower and invited him back to his kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so then it continues &ldquo;On the northwest corner&rdquo; or
          &ldquo;the northwest border.&rdquo; And so it is said that in this
          area of Uddiyana there somewhere in Pakistan, then somewhere in the
          northwest, in the very border between the north and the west was the
          actual place where the lotus flower arose and where Guru Rinpoche then
          took miraculous birth.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so India has four great rivers, four great bodies of water. And
          the first one is called the Sindhu River, which is called so because
          if you go down this river you see an area of water that is red in
          color, like the sindhura color, like the sindhura root. And so it is
          called Sindhura Lake because it is red in color. And then if you go
          down to the edge of this body of water, it leads to almost like the
          mouth of a huge, almost an ocean-like body of water, which is called
          the Lake of Milk, the Milky Lake of the Southwest. And actually this
          Milky Lake of the Southwest, in Tibetan called [Tso Omasin???]. The
          Milky Lake of the Southwest was actually where Guru Rinpoche took
          birth in the center of a lotus flower.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so it is also over... In this area there are a lot of naga beings
          &mdash; nagas or serpent spirits. And the king of the nagas, named
          Jokpo, his abode is under the water there. And so Guru
          Rinpoche&rsquo;s lotus flower then... the stem of this lotus flower
          was right above the very top or peak of the abode or celestial mansion
          of the king of the nagas named Jokpo. That&rsquo;s there the basic
          lotus flower was. So in the next line... So &ldquo;In the northwest
          corner in the country of Orgyen in the pollen heart of a
          lotus...&rdquo; And the pollen heart of the lotus literally is
          described to be geographically over the residence where the King Jokpo
          of the nagas resides.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so then Guru Rinpoche born there in the pollen heart of this lotus
          flower... Then the way this occurred is that in the western pure land,
          the Lord Protector Buddha Amitabha emanated out rays of red light or
          emanated out a red HRI syllable from his heart and rays of red light,
          which then manifested a lotus flower in the center of which is like
          the very pollen heart, like the pistil of the lotus flower. And in the
          pollen heart of this lotus flower, then the great illustrious
          Avolokitesvara, Chenrezig, then came and blessed the lotus flower. And
          there arose the emanation of Guru Rinpoche. And so then Guru Rinpoche
          took birth there upon this lotus flower.
        </p>
        <p>
          And calling the land of Uddiyana somewhere in Pakistan is not saying
          it&rsquo;s exactly down there on the map, but that it&rsquo;s
          somewhere in this general area. And the reason it is called
          &ldquo;Orgyen yul&rdquo; or the Land of Orgyen, the Land of Uddiyana,
          is because this was the name of the place when Indrabodhi, the king,
          was there in reign. And this is where he went when he found Guru
          Rinpoche there and brought him back, and invited him to take over the
          kingdom, invited him to the kingdom as the prince. And so that is why
          it is called the Land of Orgyen. This is the area in which he was
          invited &mdash; the empire.
        </p>
        <p>
          So most of you probably already know this story. And so I&rsquo;m
          thinking, you know, most of you have already heard this and are
          familiar with it... the story of how actually King Indrabodhi came to
          find Guru Rinpoche and invite him back to the palace. But even if you
          already know it, I&rsquo;m thinking that it&rsquo;s better that I do
          say it anyway. It would be better to do that because otherwise
          it&rsquo;d be like we&rsquo;re leaving out a very important part of
          the story, kind of skipping over an important segment. So then I will
          say it in any case.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the story of King Indrabodhi, just in brief, is that the king was
          incredibly powerful, had incredible sovereignty, and was incredibly
          wealthy. And yet he could not seem to produce an heir. He could not
          give birth to a son. And so this going on for a long time, he realized
          that he needed to do something about this. And so he went to consult
          with every single divination master in the land, every single
          astrologer in the land, and asking all the diviners and astrologers
          what they saw that he could do in order to produce an heir, to
          actually produce a son. Then all of them said one thing, &ldquo;You
          must give all of your wealth to the poor, you must give all of your
          wealth to the needy, and you need to accumulate merit. So if you
          gather accumulations by practicing generosity, giving everything you
          have, whatever you can, to the needy and the poor, then you will be
          able to have a son.&rdquo; And so then he also went to those who had
          psychic powers, a clairvoyance, and they said the same thing. So every
          single one who did divinations and everyone who did astrology, all the
          masters who had clairvoyance, they all said with a single voice,
          &ldquo;You must do this. Give everything you have to the poor and to
          the village.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          And so this is what he did. Because he was extremely wealthy, he had
          many treasuries of wealth. He had incredible gold storehouses,
          storehouses filled with gold and jewels and turquoise and the finest,
          finest foods and so forth, the finest raiment. He had storehouses of
          everything imaginable in his vast kingdom. And so in accordance with
          the suggestions of all of these diviners and astrologers, then he went
          and opened up all of storehouses and he basically just said,
          &ldquo;Come forth!&rdquo; to all the of beggars. He just said
          &ldquo;Come, all of you!&rdquo; He opened his doors for all of the
          poor to just come and take whatever they wanted. And so what he did
          was he simply offered whatever the person needed, whether the person
          wanted clothes or the person needed food or they wanted money and
          wealth, whatever it was. And he would give it like a wish-fulfilling
          jewel from his treasuries. And so this he continued to do to hundreds
          of thousands of beggars and poor.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so this went on for many years until eventually his vast
          storehouses were emptied and all of his wealth was exhausted. But
          still more beggars continued to come. And so feeling forlorn and
          frustrated, he went to consult his ministers because he felt that,
          &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t turn these people away, but I have nothing
          left. I&rsquo;ve given everything I have. And so now I still
          don&rsquo;t have a son. And it seems that all of this was just
          pointless. And now I&rsquo;ve lost everything that I have.&rdquo; And
          so being in this state of being disheartened, he consulted with all of
          his ministers, and they were pretty much equally confused. They
          didn&rsquo;t really have a good answer, and all they could say was,
          &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s only one option left, you know. On the
          other side of the vast lake, there is rumored to be a wish- fulfilling
          jewel. And this wish-fulfilling jewel, if you&rsquo;re able to obtain
          it at great cost, then once it&rsquo;s in your hands whatever you wish
          for will be spontaneously granted. And so immediately the king devised
          a plan to be able to go and actually find this wish-fulfilling jewel.
          But all of the ministers tried to stop him and really suggested he did
          not try to make this kind of perilous journey. But he still had a
          plan. He was basically determined. And so he made the plan to go and
          figure out a way to obtain this jewel.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so then when the king went to go and announce his decision to all
          of the ministers that he was going to go and try to find this
          wish-fulfilling jewel on the other side of the vast body of water,
          then all of the ministers tried to get him not to go. They tried to
          make him change his mind and they said, &ldquo;You really
          shouldn&rsquo;t do this. You&rsquo;re already old. You&rsquo;re
          advanced in age. It&rsquo;s extremely dangerous to try and go. And
          there have been many, many journeyers, many who have tried to go in
          the past. And not a single one has returned because they have either
          been attacked by the wild serpent spirit being in the water, or they
          have just been attacked by all of the dangers along the way on the
          perilous journey. So it&rsquo;s extremely difficult to actually make
          it there. And so it&rsquo;s best that you do not attempt that and thus
          risk your life.&rdquo; But the king was adamant and he wasn&rsquo;t
          going to listen to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so he announced to all of the subjects in the kingdom and tried to
          find anyone who could say that they&rsquo;ve at least made that
          journey and come back to tell about it. And there was only one old,
          old man in the entire kingdom who had once been a ferryman and ferried
          in a boat across the water. So he had been able to return. By now his
          hair was white and he was seeped in old age, but he was the only one
          who had ever been, who knew the way, who knew how to lead someone
          there. And so he reluctantly told the king that, yes, he had been
          there. And the king then asked him if he would be his boatman and
          ferry him across the water. And the old man became very frightened,
          and he really tried to dissuade the king from making him do this. He
          said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very dangerous.&rdquo; And what he was
          thinking was, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the king. You&rsquo;re the most
          powerful and important man in the kingdom. And if I take you across
          the river and I don&rsquo;t bring you back, the entire country&rsquo;s
          going to be very upset with me.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          And so thinking of this he was extremely scared for his life and for
          the king&rsquo;s life. And he didn&rsquo;t trust the journey himself.
          But the king had to give his command and there was no choice. He had
          to listen. So the king tried to reassure him saying, &ldquo;Okay, as
          long as you just do the job of carrying me across the water... Tell me
          everything we need. I will make all the preparations from my side. And
          then you just be the one to lead us, to take us along the water in the
          boat.&rdquo; And so the old boatman then gave him all the instructions
          of preparations needed to be made. And [he said], &ldquo;Okay,
          we&rsquo;ll need this and you&rsquo;ll need this kind of thing. And
          we&rsquo;ll need all of these materials.&rdquo; And so the king then
          arranged for everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          And finally bringing a retinue of 500 along with him in this boat,
          then the king and 500 of his retinue went led by this old ferryman
          across the water to fetch the wish-fulfilling jewel. And they
          journeyed and journeyed. And it was an extremely long journey. They
          had been journeying for over one month&rsquo;s time and still they had
          more to go. And finally they were getting closer and closer to their
          destination, to the island where the jewel resided. And so the old man
          was the only one who was able to determine, who knew where the land
          would be and what it looked like and how to recognize it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now also another aspect of this story is that the king was blind. He
          didn&rsquo;t have working vision. But yet as a sign of the blessings
          of this wish-fulfilling jewel, then even by coming into the vicinity
          of the jewel, then one of his eyes restored its eyesight. And so all
          of the a sudden the king was pointing at all of the different colored
          mountains &mdash; the white, the yellow, and all of these different
          mountain ranges that he could see on the horizon they were coming to
          approach. And his retinue was absolutely flabbergasted and they said,
          &ldquo;How is it that you can see this?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;I
          don&rsquo;t know. My vision in this one eye...&rdquo; One of his eyes
          had been restored to vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so then the old man finally found the exact land and where they
          had to go. And so he said, &ldquo;Okay, now the rest of you wait. The
          only one who can go to find this jewel has to have incredible merit,
          really be a lucky person with good merit because there are many wild
          animals. It&rsquo;s extremely dangerous, extremely perilous along this
          area, so the only one who can really come must have tremendous merit.
          So saying this, then the king said, &ldquo;Okay, well, I will
          go.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          And they went to this place where the old man led them and then they
          found this one structure like a building or a house. And there was a
          golden vajra, kind of like a doorknocker, like a golden vajra
          doorknocker. And they clapped the door. And then it was opened. And
          they were told... Because in this area now, on this island, there were
          tons and tons of jewels, all kinds of precious jewels like coral and
          ruby and all kinds of things, anything you can desire. But they were
          very directly instructed, &ldquo;Okay, do not take the wrong jewel.
          Make sure... A girl will come, a very special, unusually unique girl
          will come and appear. And when she appears, she will give you this
          wish-fulfilling jewel. But do not mistake it. Do not go about picking
          up another ordinary jewel and taking it back with you without
          recognizing the wish-fulfilling jewel.&rdquo; And so doing as they
          were instructed, then when the girl came and they actually got the
          wish-fulfilling jewel then they felt a little bit relieved. So now
          they could go ahead and they were told that, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
          allowed to pick up other jewels if you want because now you have the
          wish-fulfilling jewel. So it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re
          protected.&rdquo; But then the old man also said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
          take too much because we might sink the boat.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so then they gathered whatever jewels that they were to gather.
          And as the king was walking back with the old man with the
          wish-fulfilling jewel in his hands, then meanwhile at the edge, by the
          actual foot of the lake then wandering around was the king&rsquo;s
          kind of like secretary. His treasurer was like a merchant who acted as
          the king&rsquo;s treasurer, one of his attendants. And he was
          wandering around examining all of the beautiful flowers and the lake
          and looking at the scenery. And all of a sudden he looked up and there
          in the lake were all of these incredible, beautiful flowers. But then
          there was one that was unlike all of the others, because all of the
          others had already opened and bloomed. But this one was still the bud.
          It had not quite opened yet. And also it was extremely beautiful and
          it was encased and showering, emanating out all of these rainbows and
          light rays. So it was inconceivably different than the others. And
          seeing this kind of stupendous, unbelievable sight, then the treasurer
          went to go and tell the king that something unusual is here. This
          flower isn&rsquo;t like all of the others. And in addition to that,
          then when he went to look back before he went to go and tell the king
          what he found, then the flower began to open. The lotus flower opened
          up and there in the center was an extremely beautiful, young boy, like
          a magical boy who then took this miraculous birth in the center of
          this flower.
        </p>
        <p>
          So then knowing that the king was on his way back, then the treasurer
          went to go and tell the king to come and look at this to see what it
          could be. But then he knew, of course the king couldn&rsquo;t see, so
          he would have to just describe it to him. But then when he brought the
          king with him, the king pointed and said, &ldquo;Wow! Look at this
          incredible lotus flower with all of these light rays.&rdquo; And the
          treasurer was surprised. He said, &ldquo;You can see that?!&rdquo; And
          the king said, &ldquo;Yes, because now due to the power of the
          blessings...&rdquo; First he got one eyesight restored, and now again
          due to the blessings of Guru Rinpoche and the birth of Guru Rinpoche
          now both of his eyes were restored to vision and he was able to behold
          everything perfectly. And so then he realized that it was because of
          all the many years that he had made offerings and practiced generosity
          he had gained a great deal of merit, King Indrabodhi. And so for that
          then he had been able to behold all of this incredible sight. And
          there before him Guru Rinpoche in the form of this young boy was there
          in the center of this miraculous lotus flower. And so then King
          Indrabodhi in absolute amazement then invited the young boy to come
          and be the prince, to be his son.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so then he actually brought the young boy, Guru Rinpoche, together
          with the entire stem of the lotus flower and carried him. And then
          they brought him back to the kingdom. And the king then also made an
          announcement to all of his subjects and all of the people in the
          kingdom and in the palace, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bringing back my son now
          with me. I&rsquo;m bringing the heir to the throne, a prince, here.
          And so now please get ready with the procession.&rdquo; And so they
          had a huge procession with all of the cymbals and the music and all of
          the incredible banquets to welcome this prince to the kingdom. And
          there then Guru Rinpoche was instated within the palace of the king.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so if I didn&rsquo;t say this, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been okay.
          So I had to tell you at least this much.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so then having brought... Guru Rinpoche invited him to the
          kingdom. Then the king had fulfilled one of his wishes. Through this
          wish-fulfilling jewel, he had found a son, an heir. And so then also,
          through the wish-fulfilling jewel, he was able to fill all of his
          treasuries. So praying, supplicating the jewel, then all of his
          treasuries and storehouses that had been emptied were filled again.
          And now he could give to the poor like never before. And so there was
          even more to given than before &mdash; enough for all of the poor and
          the needy.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so then Guru Rinpoche spent some time there maintaining his reign
          over the kingdom as the prince. And then the deities came and told
          him, &ldquo;Okay, now the time has come for you to renounce the world,
          to renounce samsara, and to enact to the benefit of sentient beings.
          Without renouncing the worldly samsara, you will not be able to
          benefit beings. Thus now time has come to renounce the kingdom and to
          go on your way to further your enactment of enlightened activities for
          the benefit of beings.&rdquo; And so seeing this, then Guru Rinpoche
          knew that he would have to renounce the kingdom by using skillful
          means, some kind of strategy. He would not be able to just simply
          leave. There would have to be a way that would allow him to leave the
          kingdom in a way that would work. And so then he devised a plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course there are many different explanations and accounts of this,
          but this is one story, one account. And so he went to the top of the
          roof and he brought his staff, like his khatvanga or his staff. And
          holding his staff over the top of the roof of the castle then he
          dropped it. He let it drop so that it landed on a mara demon, which
          actually destroyed the demon, liberating him. But at the same time it
          broke a major law because here he was basically committing the act of
          killing and dropping his staff. And so as he had broken one of the
          major laws of the kingdom, that he himself was no exception, he also
          had to fall under the perjury [sic] of the law. And so then all of the
          ministers and all of the king... the father and the queen, the king
          and the queen, they all came to figure out what the right course of
          action would be. And of course they didn&rsquo;t want him to leave.
          But there was either the choice of he was to be executed or sometime
          terrible, some horrible punishment, or he was to be ostracized and
          simply excommunicated, made to leave to the far, far reaches of the
          borderland somewhere. And so because they couldn&rsquo;t bear the idea
          of him being executed, then they banished him to the far outskirts of
          this area, which was extremely dangerous. It was like a charnel ground
          area. But actually this was perfect for Guru Rinpoche. He accomplished
          his intention. And so now he freely left the kingdom then.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so this is how he was able to skillfully renounce the kingdom and
          then go. And this is where there are many, many accounts of Guru
          Rinpoche and how he lived, enacted his enlightened activities
          throughout the fearful charnel grounds. And in this way then this is
          how through skillful means he was able to escape or renounce the
          kingdom. Now then there are further accounts of how he went to India
          and manifested the attainment of all of the siddhis and
          accomplishments, and then how he tamed countless beings and nestled
          them into the dharma and liberated them through dharma.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then finally he actually returned to the Land of Orgyen, the
          kingdom of Indrabodhi. And there he turned the wheel of the dharma and
          taught everyone there. Then it is the case that it is said that
          every... it was almost as if the kingdom just became completely
          emptied &mdash; null and void &mdash; because every single person
          there who he taught the dharma to attained rainbow body. So then after
          everyone attained rainbow body, it was like it was just left
          abandoned. There was nobody left.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so this is the story of how Guru Rinpoche&rsquo;s... and this is
          why it is the first of the Seven Line Prayer &ldquo;In the country of
          Orgyen&rdquo; &mdash; because Orgyen was where he came, where he was
          invited, where he demonstrated the activity of renouncing samsara,
          renouncing the kingdom. And it&rsquo;s also where he returned later to
          turn the wheel of dharma and where he ended up nestling all of the
          subjects and all of the residents of Orgyen there into the dharma, and
          thus emptying the entire kingdom because they all attained liberation,
          rainbow body.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so then Guru Rinpoche displayed unimaginable, inconceivable
          enlightened activities for the sake of the Buddha&rsquo;s teachings
          throughout India and Tibet. And so part of the story of the life of
          Guru Rinpoche is how he was, on more than one occasion, placed in
          situations in which he was almost... there were attempted
          assassinations. That is to say, he was tempted [sic] to be burnt alive
          on a pyre. And so the first time this happened was in Zahor and the
          second time was also in the Land of Orgyen because don&rsquo;t forget
          that he himself had made himself so that he was banished from the
          Kingdom of Orgyen. So when he came back, there were many who still had
          a lot of skepticism and doubt. And so then there was an attempt on his
          life to try and burn him alive in this giant pyre, this giant fire,
          cremation fire. But then displaying countless miraculous activities,
          then... In this case he had transformed the fire into a lake and then
          people found him standing there in the midst of this self-arising
          lotus flower. And so seeing this, then people had tremendous faith and
          devotion arise for him. And it is in this way that he tamed the minds
          of countless beings (through displaying miraculous activities) and
          turned their minds to the dharma.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now there are some places you can actually visit. In terms of where he
          was exactly where he had transformed this fire into a lake, it used to
          be that it was surrounded by some mountain regions and you could visit
          it. But then there was a tremendous earthquake and so now you
          can&rsquo;t see any more this exact area, so it&rsquo;s not visible.
          But what is visible, what you can still see is you can go to actually
          the Land of Orgyen to the very lake. And you can actually see the lake
          where it is said that the lotus flower self-arose and there arose Guru
          Rinpoche. So this is something that you can all actually see directly
          with your own eyes, this very area and lake. And so this is the
          meaning of these two lines &ldquo;On the northwest corner of the
          country of Orgyen in the pollen heart of a lotus.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;You attained marvelous, miraculous siddhis&rdquo; is the third
          line &ldquo;yatsen chokgi ngodrup nyay.&rdquo; And so what this means
          is that he demonstrated the attainment of the supreme and the common
          siddhis, spiritual attainments. In fact once he took the miraculous
          birth on the lotus flower, then the deities, all of the lamas, the
          yidams, the dakinis, the three roots, sources of refuge, the buddhas,
          and bodhisattvas filled the entire sky, all of space, and conferred
          their blessings and empowerments. And in that very moment then he
          manifested the attainment of sublime and common siddhis. And so that
          is why it is said &ldquo;You have attained marvelous, most excellent
          siddhis.&rdquo; &ldquo;Most excellent&rdquo; are supreme siddhis, the
          supreme-most siddhis, and then the common siddhis as well. So he has
          attained all the attainments, all the spiritual attainments.
        </p>
        <p>
          And likewise &ldquo;kordu khandro mangpo kor,&rdquo; &ldquo;You are
          surrounded by a retinue of many dakinis.&rdquo; Because even when he
          first took birth in the center of this lotus flower, then all of the
          many dakinis from the celestial realms, the pure lands, came and
          circumambulated him and offered enormous, inconceivable feasts,
          ganachakra feast offerings and celebration and so forth. And so that
          is why he&rsquo;s always surrounded by a retinue of many dakinis.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so we should all try to see this place of Orgyen, where you can
          still actually visibly see where the lake is and where the lotus
          flower arose.
        </p>
        <p>Rinpoche speaks.</p>
        <p>
          And then the next line &ldquo;kyaykyi jaysu dakdrup kyi,&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Following your footsteps, I shall practice.&rdquo; And so we
          are praying, supplicating Guru Rinpoche. We are saying, &ldquo;I
          supplicate you. I follow after you. I shall accomplish and actualize
          you. And so I am praying to you.&rdquo; And we are asking him,
          &ldquo;Please come to bestow your blessings. I supplicate to you to
          come and bless us. Bestow your blessings upon me. Bestow your
          blessings upon us.&rdquo; And so you&rsquo;re asking Guru Rinpoche to
          appear and bless you.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then finally you have the four words which is the actual mantra
          recitation, &ldquo;GURU PEMA SIDDHI HUNG.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          And so this prayer is not something that is newfangled. In fact this
          prayer has been around for ages. It is an age-old prayer that is the
          one... the very same prayer that began to flourish in the pure land of
          khach&ouml; or the celestial pure land of the mamos and dakinis, which
          is the very Vajra Seven Lines that they use to invite Guru Rinpoche,
          to invoke his blessings. And so likewise in Tibet all of the termas,
          that is the great hidden treasures that Guru Rinpoche then concealed
          for future generations, all of these that... you will see them, the
          ones that are revealed by the great treasure- revealers like Dorje
          Lingpa, Sangye Lingpa, and so forth, all of these have within them as
          a part of them the Seven Line Prayer. So you will find the Seven Line
          Prayer in all of these termas, the treasures. And so it is... Of all
          of the prayers of supplication to Guru Rinpoche, this one has the most
          blessings and the most potency. There are many different supplication
          prayers of Guru Rinpoche, but none has more blessings, none is as
          all-encompassing as the Seven Line Prayer. And all the blessings of
          all supplications are completely condensed into this single seven
          lines, into this single prayer. And that is why it is called the Vajra
          Seven Line Prayer, Dorje Tsigdun Sol-Deb.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so if you really recite this prayer from your heart, then
          there&rsquo;s no way that you can avoid bringing Guru Rinpoche forth
          and invoking him. So it&rsquo;s extremely powerful. And you should
          practice it at all times continually. And when you do this
          you&rsquo;re inviting... Like for example whenever we recite this
          prayer, also as the Vajra Seven Line Invocation or Invitation, we are
          actually inviting Guru Rinpoche, supplicating him to bless our mind
          streams. And if you maintain this, if you really focus on the Seven
          Line Prayer, then it is certain that the blessings will come. The
          blessings of Guru Rinpoche will spring out and be born in your mind
          stream. And so there&rsquo;s tremendous blessings of this practice.
          And that is why we actually say in the verse &ldquo;chingyi lap-chir
          sheksu sol,&rdquo; &ldquo;Please, Guru Rinpoche, come in order to
          bestow blessings.&rdquo; And so it&rsquo;s actually in the words, the
          supplication. We&rsquo;re invoking Guru Rinpoche.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so really give it your all and do your best in trying to maintain
          the practice of Seven Line Prayer, the Seven Line Invocation of Guru
          Rinpoche. And so if you are able to do this, a good kind of sadhana or
          practice in which you can practice and accumulate the Seven Line
          Prayer is by Mipham Rinpoche &mdash; the Shower of Blessings practice
          by Mipham Rinpoche, which is concise, condensed. It&rsquo;s not too
          much. Because if it&rsquo;s too much, then it becomes a problem for us
          because we just have too much to recite. But then if it&rsquo;s too
          short then that&rsquo;s also a problem. This is just the right length.
          It&rsquo;s nice and concise and not too long, not too many words. And
          so if you can all practice in the context of the Seven Line Prayer,
          then there is great benefit in this. And particularly also, when you
          do your tsok, your ganachakra feast offerings, this also has a very
          short one-page tsok offering. So you can also accumulate your
          ganachakra feast in the context of the sadhana of the Seven Line
          Invocation of Guru Rinpoche. And if you want to practice this
          together, recite it together in a group, that&rsquo;s great. And also
          you can do it on your own as your own individual practice using the
          Shower of Blessings. And so it&rsquo;s very good if you can do the
          offerings of the tsok and ganachakra in the context of this practice.
          I don&rsquo;t know if you have this text or not, but it is available
          in English, so it would be good to recite that.
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"></p>
        <p>
          Now most importantly when you recite the Seven Line Invitation
          Invocation of Guru Rinpoche, the most important thing depends upon
          your faith. You have to have the faith which is known... the faith of
          absolute confidence of the presence of Guru Rinpoche, which is often
          known as the faith of surrender, the faith that you know, the faith
          that feels that &ldquo;Whether I am high or low, whatever position I
          am in, wherever I am and whatever my circumstance, Guru Rinpoche, you
          know me. You are aware of me.&rdquo; And that kind of heart-felt
          confidence and faith, the trust that surrenders to Guru Rinpoche, is
          known as the faith of utter surrender, the utter trusting faith. And
          when that kind of faith arises from the bottom of your heart, then
          anybody can assert, can confidently tell you, &ldquo;Yes, the
          blessings will definitely enter into your mind stream.&rdquo; But
          without faith, then even if you go through many recitations with your
          mouth of the Seven Line Prayer, there&rsquo;s no certainty that the
          blessings will enter. Why? Because the doorway to the blessings
          entering depends upon your faith and devotion. And so when your own
          faith and devotion in Guru Rinpoche meets with the innate blessings of
          the Seven Line Prayer, when these two factors come into confluence,
          then there is blessings. Then the blessings can actually penetrate.
          But you need to have one-pointed faith and devotion, single-pointed.
          If you don&rsquo;t have faith...
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course there&rsquo;s many kinds of faith, that being said. There is
          the lucid faith of admiration. There is the faith of desire that is
          the desiring that desires to accomplish the state. Then there is the
          faith of confidence and the faith that does not turn back &mdash;
          irreversible faith. Out of these four types of faith, the most
          important types are the faith of confidence, otherwise known as the
          faith of trust, and the faith that is irreversible, the faith that
          will never turn back. And the faith of confidence is like this kind of
          faith, where you feel whether I am high or low, whether I am happy or
          sad, no matter what, your mind is absolutely 100 percent convinced
          &ldquo;Guru Rinpoche, you know you are fully aware of me and I
          surrender to you.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s almost &ldquo;I am in your
          hands.&rdquo; So this kind of faith... &ldquo;No matter what happens,
          Guru Rinpoche, I have no one to rely on. I have no one to pray to. I
          have no other hope, no other refuge besides you.&rdquo; That utter,
          utter surrendering faith of confidence... And then coupled with the
          faith that is irreversible, which means that no matter what happens,
          whatever situation one is in, whether one is happy or sad, one can
          never lose one&rsquo;s faith. One&rsquo;s faith is beyond the ability
          to turn it. And one cannot have wrong view, cannot lose one&rsquo;s
          faith. So one&rsquo;s faith is indestructible. When you get to that
          kind of level of faith and you have both of these faiths, then the
          blessings can definitely enter you. And so whether the blessings of
          the practice come or not depends upon your faith. And so that is why
          it is said, if you have confidence, if you have trust, the blessings
          enter. If you have a mind free of doubts, your aims can be
          accomplished.
        </p>
        <p>
          Guru Rinpoche himself said, &ldquo;When you recite the Seven Line
          Prayer, do so without any doubt, without any skepticism in your
          mind.&rdquo; Because if you&rsquo;re doing the Seven Line Prayer and
          then you have this sort of skeptical, dubious mind that wonders,
          &ldquo;Oh, is Guru Rinpoche really coming or not?&rdquo; or
          &ldquo;Really, how do I know?&rdquo;... and with this kind of dubious
          mind, then the blessings are not able to enter. So have one-pointed
          conviction. Have conviction beyond any shadow of a doubt. Do not let
          doubt enter. When you do not have doubt and when you have confidence
          and trust, then the blessings can really enter you. Then it is certain
          that you will get the blessing.
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"></p>
        <p>
          And so that being said, then thinking of all of the beings of the six
          realms, the six classes of migration, and the suffering of all of
          these realms, the suffering of hell beings of intense hot and cold,
          the suffering of hungry ghosts, preta beings, of intense hunger and
          thirst, the suffering of animals with subjugation and of predators,
          the suffering of gods of falling transition and actually the dying
          transition and falling into the lower realms, the suffering of the
          asuras, the jealous god realms, the suffering of bickering and
          fighting, the suffering of worldly beings who are in the human
          realm... look at all of the worldly human beings. Human beings are
          completely distracted, completely distracted with worldly life to the
          point that they have no leisure time, no free time because
          they&rsquo;re so busy, busy-busy and distracted in trying to attain
          food, trying to help their family, trying to attain wealth, trying to
          maintain and accomplish more samsara, more worldly activity. So they
          have no time. They are completely and utterly enraptured in the world,
          in the worldly phenomena. For all of these beings in the six realms
          who are completely filled with suffering, then one feels... From the
          bottom of one&rsquo;s heart, one is praying to Guru Rinpoche saying,
          &ldquo;Guru Rinpoche, please be aware of me. Please heed me. You know.
          You know all us beings in the three realms of samsara. For all of us
          we have no other protector, no other refuge besides you. Please, Guru
          Rinpoche, please grant us your protection.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          And feeling in this way, this will give rise to a sort of solemn
          longing, like almost like a sadness. And that will be so powerful,
          such a powerful faith it should evoke tears in your eyes and goose
          bumps. And when Guru Rinpoche himself said that as you&rsquo;re
          praying and supplicating him single-pointedly with this almost like
          mournful kind of longing like a sorrow and faith and longing, then
          when these tears start to stream down your cheeks, then Guru Rinpoche
          himself has it said in writing, &ldquo;For each tear that falls down
          your cheek, this is more and more of your sins and obscurations are
          being purified and cleansed away.&rdquo; And so for every tear, you
          are purifying an inconceivable amount of negative karma and
          obscurations. And so when you have this kind of intense, overpowering,
          completely single-pointed faith and longing that brings tears to your
          eyes, then this is a sign that the blessings are entering into you.
          And until you get to some of this feeling, then this is a sign that
          the blessings are coming.
        </p>
        <p>Rinpoche speaks.</p>
        <p>
          And so at first it&rsquo;s very difficult to have this really deep,
          deep kind of almost like a longing sadness, sorrowful faith, and
          devotion that calls out to Guru Rinpoche to the point where it just
          brings these tears to your eyes. That kind of real faith is very hard
          to have in the very beginning. And so it&rsquo;s something you just
          continue to develop. And then if you&rsquo;re able to, when you have
          this kind of intense longing, that&rsquo;s almost like a sorrowful
          faith and longing for Guru Rinpoche.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when you do the Seven Line Prayer and invoke Guru Rinpoche on the
          tenth day, Guru Rinpoche Day, or the twenty-fifth day, the Dakini Day,
          and so forth, on these particular holy days when you invoke Guru
          Rinpoche, then you will have signs of his blessings different and more
          potent than before. And one of these signs is that you will find
          suddenly that a new kind of disgust or sadness with samsara will
          arise, and you will begin to see that samsara, the worldly dharma, has
          no essence. And when you begin to see the essence-less pointlessness
          of samsara, then this is a sign of the blessings of Guru Rinpoche
          starting to enter into you. And likewise you will feel, even stronger
          than ever before, a real urgency and desire to attain enlightenment.
          And when that urgency comes, too, that really feels &ldquo;I must
          attain awakening then, the same way,&rdquo; then this is a sign of
          Guru Rinpoche&rsquo;s blessings entering into your mind stream. And so
          when you get these tears that come, well up from deep from your heart
          as you&rsquo;re supplicating Guru Rinpoche, then your mind will
          change. Your mind starts to change. It becomes different. And this is
          almost like a sadness, like a gentle, tender longing. And this is also
          a sign of Guru Rinpoche&rsquo;s blessings actually touching you,
          entering you when you have these tears come and this kind of intense
          longing.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so in the beginning you will have the feeling that Guru Rinpoche
          is somehow outside, out there... that Guru Rinpoche is outwardly
          present before you. Eventually, however, if you continue, you will
          realize that, &ldquo;Oh, my mind and Guru Rinpoche, there&rsquo;s no
          difference!&rdquo; And then you will say, &ldquo;Oh, the very essence
          of my mind is in fact Guru Rinpoche.&rdquo; And then when you start to
          realize that Guru Rinpoche abides within and is not out there, but
          he&rsquo;s actually the very nature of your mind, then you have really
          gotten... you&rsquo;ve developed along. So in the beginning now, yes,
          Guru Rinpoche is outside. He&rsquo;s there external. But eventually
          then you will see Guru Rinpoche to be within.
        </p>
        <p>Rinpoche speaks.</p>
        <p>
          So that&rsquo;s good that you&rsquo;re crying. It means you&rsquo;re
          moved by this.
        </p>
        <p>
          So then all of you do not slack on the Seven Line Prayer. You should
          make this your primary, main practice for your dharma center. Or your
          dharma center, it should be your main practice. So you should make
          this the principle practice for your center, the Seven Line Prayer.
          Vajra Guru Mantra should be really our main center&rsquo;s practice,
          what you are striving... And do not miss or skip the ganachakra
          offering feasts for the tenth and the twenty-fifth day, that is Guru
          Rinpoche Day, the tenth, and then the twenty-fifth, Dakini Day. So
          make sure that you offer a tsok on these days. Now you don&rsquo;t
          have to make it too elaborate because the more you have to do, then
          the easier it is to skip it. So it&rsquo;s better that you have less,
          but you do a nice job. And so try to collect a little bit
        </p>
        <p>
          Teachings on the Seven Line Prayer &mdash; Yangthang Tulku &mdash;
          Santa Monica, December 9, 2006 &ndash; 17 of 21 &ndash;
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"></p>
        <p>
          of money, one dollar here, five dollars here, from everybody, and buy
          a nice bunch of offerings for the tsok. And then arrange it very
          nicely and neatly &mdash; very pleasing offerings that delight the
          mind, that are pleasing, that you enjoy. Likewise when you set up your
          shrine and you set up the tsok and you&rsquo;re arranging the tsok
          offering and the substances, don&rsquo;t do it in a sloppy manner, but
          do it in a very beautiful and pristine, pleasant manner that delights
          the mind. This is another profound way of accumulating merit,
          gathering accumulation. And if you want to offer incense, offer it
          nicely. If you want to offer flowers, offer nice beautiful pleasing
          flowers and something that really pleases the mind. If you don&rsquo;t
          have a lot to offer, that&rsquo;s okay. Whatever you have, you offer
          it nicely and pristinely. And you do so... you have the understanding
          that this is a representational physical offering, but along with it
          feel that you are offering all of the substances of enjoyment, all of
          the enjoyments and possessions of all of the three realms in the
          worldly... of the gods and humans of the three realms, and that these
          are all arranged as a pleasing offering.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then you arrange the tsok and you do the recitation of the verses
          in accordance with the visualization as it is explained. And then you
          recite the invocation, the Seven Line Prayer &mdash; accumulate that.
          Then you go through the actual sadhana itself, go through the tsok
          offering sadhana, offer the tsok, the confession, do the liberation
          and all the stages of the traditional ganachakra. And then when you
          finish that, then you can enjoy, partake in the siddhis in the tsok.
          And so this tsok or ganachakra is a very special and extraordinary
          means for gathering your accumulations. So when you talk about
          gathering accumulations and purifying obscurations, then the tsok
          offering is a supreme means, a very unusual and extraordinary means of
          gathering accumulations. And so try not to really skip or forget to do
          the tsok ganachakra offerings on the tenth lunar day and the
          twenty-fifth lunar day. Maintain that uninterruptedly.
        </p>
        <p>
          And even though in this particular sadhana, Shower of Blessings, there
          is no remainders, there&rsquo;s no part for the remainders, but you
          can actually take it from another sadhana or liturgy if you want to do
          remainders, if you want to do the section of remainders that generally
          goes in tsok. Of course, if you choose not to do it, there is no
          contradiction. There is no transgression in itself. But it&rsquo;s
          always nice to offer the remainders if you want to take it from
          another liturgy and kind of supplement it with this tsok within the
          Shower of Blessings tsok because in this way the remainders help you
          to... To those who do not have the fortune to partake in the actual
          first portion, then you are sort of... The blessings of Guru Rinpoche
          are being shared with the beings and protectors and
        </p>
        <p>
          Teachings on the Seven Line Prayer &mdash; Yangthang Tulku &mdash;
          Santa Monica, December 9, 2006 &ndash; 18 of 21 &ndash;
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"></p>
        <p>
          so forth who do not have the opportunity to partake in the actual
          first portion. So it&rsquo;s good to offer the remainders. And so if
          you&rsquo;re able to offer the tsok in this way, then that&rsquo;s
          very good.
        </p>
        <p>Rinpoche speaks.</p>
        <p>
          And so then henceforth if you are able in your dharma center really
          for each and every person to maintain practice of the Seven Line
          Invocation Invitation Prayer to Guru Rinpoche, if each individual
          isn&rsquo;t able to on their own accumulate a great deal, then at
          least if one or two people can take on accumulating 100,000 Seven Line
          Prayers, this would be of great benefit. However many you can recite,
          then there&rsquo;s more benefit. So really it&rsquo;s just a plus.
          It&rsquo;s more of a benefit to however much... if you want to do
          100,000 or 200,000, however many you can recite to that extent,
          there&rsquo;s more benefit in it. If everybody is able to do 100,000
          Seven Line Prayers and then on top of that 100,000 Vajra Guru Mantras,
          then this would be extremely good, extremely good.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so also henceforth if you are able, it would be very good if you
          are able to really maintain the commitment of keeping ganachakra feast
          offerings for the tenth and the twenty-fifth lunar days of every
          month. And so if you are not able to make it for the tsok, then at
          least on these days really remember to maintain... to recite the Seven
          Line Prayer and the Vajra Guru Mantra because of course you do the
          tsok whenever you can. Whenever you have free time, you should strive
          in accumulating Seven Line Prayer and Vajra Guru. But for you, really,
          if the tsok doesn&rsquo;t fall on a Sunday or a Saturday, then
          it&rsquo;s pretty difficult to say whether you&rsquo;ll be able to
          give tsok. But maybe you can do it early in the morning or in the
          evening time on those days. And then if it happens that the tenth or
          the twenty-fifth day fortunately falls on a weekend, then you can do
          it during the day in the sun. But otherwise then try to at least
          maintain... you know the dharma centers, they do drupchen, which is
          daily extensive accumulation practices of sadhanas and so forth. If
          it&rsquo;s difficult to be able to maintain really for most centers
          this kind of extensive accomplishment practices over a period of days,
          so as your extensive accomplishment practice, you should maintain
          ongoing recitations of the Seven Line Invocation, the Tsigdun
          [Jen-Dren???]. And each one should make this almost like your ongoing
          continual practice, like the stream or continuum of your own
          supplication.
        </p>
        <p>Rinpoche speaks.</p>
        <p>
          So whenever you&rsquo;re reciting the Vajra Guru Mantra or the Seven
          Line Prayer, in either or both cases, you should visualize Guru
          Rinpoche actually present there in the sky in front. Visualize
        </p>
        <p>
          Teachings on the Seven Line Prayer &mdash; Yangthang Tulku &mdash;
          Santa Monica, December 9, 2006 &ndash; 19 of 21 &ndash;
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"></p>
        <p>
          him there atop a lotus flower amid a lake with water of the eight
          properties, Guru Rinpoche in union with mother consort, and feel that
          he is completely surrounded by all of the rigzins, the vidyadharas,
          the intrinsic awareness holding masters of India and Tibet, all of the
          awakened ones without exception. If you are able to visualize each and
          every one clearly, that&rsquo;s great. But even if not, just have the
          understanding that they are all there present before you in the center
          of Guru Rinpoche&rsquo;s union with consort. And if you&rsquo;re able
          to visualize distinctly Guru Rinpoche&rsquo;s clothing and so forth,
          then this is great. So then when you&rsquo;re doing the visualization,
          then Guru Rinpoche is actually there present before you in the sky in
          front and you recite the Tsigdun [Jen-Drun???] or the invocation
          invitation with the Seven Line Prayer to Guru Rinpoche. And then when
          you have finished accumulating your requisite number of Seven Line
          recitations, feel that light rays emanate out from Guru
          Rinpoche&rsquo;s body and enter into you and that when they touch you
          feel that your mind stream is blessed and penetrated by the blessings
          and compassion of Guru Rinpoche. And now then you go ahead and you
          perform your tsok, your offering, and then finally feel that... At the
          end feel that from the three or five places of Guru Rinpoche, from the
          five places (in his forehead, throat, heart, navel, and secret center)
          emanate out, radiate out five colored rays of light, which enter into
          your five places. First you feel that your body, speech, and mind are
          completely purified of all of their sins and obscurations. And finally
          when the fourth light comes from the navel center... So white light
          from the forehead, red from the throat, blue from the heart, yellow
          from the navel. And if you do it (five-place visualization),
          it&rsquo;s green from the secret center. And then when light rays
          emanate out a fourth time, feel that this purifies all the subtle and
          course obscurations without exception. And finally Guru Rinpoche
          dissolves into oneself. And at this point the mind of Guru Rinpoche
          and your mind... your body and speech and mind meld inseparably.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point you rest your mind in a state without anything to focus
          on, without any focal point, without any objective reference. So in a
          non-referential state you rest you mind naturally in its own state.
          And so in this state you reside as long as you can &mdash; five or six
          minutes in this state of resting your mind in its true nature. And so
          this is a state... there&rsquo;s nothing to look at. There&rsquo;s
          nothing outside. You turn... The mind turns in on itself and observes
          itself at this point. Then you are resting your mind in its natural
          state. This is known as the meditation or the resting in equipoise.
          And this you will come to know. So do not worry if you don&rsquo;t
          know it. If you want to know what equipoise and resting you remind in
          its original state is, eventually this will become apparent to you.
          You will come to know it. And so then you rest your mind in this
          samadhi state of absorption. And
        </p>
        <p>
          Teachings on the Seven Line Prayer &mdash; Yangthang Tulku &mdash;
          Santa Monica, December 9, 2006 &ndash; 20 of 21 &ndash;
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"></p>
        <p>
          then finally you arrive from the samadhi. You reemerge. And then at
          that moment you immediately think all phenomena are the nature,
          emptiness, not anywhere really existent in and of themselves. They
          have no inherent existence. All phenomena is empty.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then again give rise to the compassion for all sentient beings and
          dedicate your roots of virtue accumulated. And so your dedication
          should be for the temporary and ultimate benefit and happiness of
          oneself and boundless sentient beings. So you dedicate your merit so
          that temporarily in the interim &ldquo;May all beings be free from
          illness. May they have long life. May they be happy. May they
          accomplish their wishes and aims. And ultimately may they all attain
          buddhahood.&rdquo; And so to this you dedicate your merit. And if you
