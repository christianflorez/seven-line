        <p>Orgyen Tobgyal Rinpoche</p>
        <p>22 June 2018, Bir, India</p>
        <p>
          Early one morning at his home in Bir, Rinpoche shared this short
          instruction with one of his friends; an instruction that sounded very
          much like his 'heart advice'. Rinpoche explained how we tend to
          receive so many different teachings that, often, we don't know where
          we should start, or which practice we should focus on. This is
          especially the case, he said, for people such as ourselves who don't
          know the Dharma very well, or who know it, but are too lazy to apply
          it. If you feel like you might be one of those people, then Rinpoche's
          answer here, in his own words, 'the fruit of 67 years of
          investigation', may be just what you need.I'm giving this teaching
          today mainly for the benefit of Harry, but you're all welcome to
          listen, if you wish.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first point I'd like to make is that, personally speaking, I have
          no idea whether or not I'm a tulku. It's not my job to say this
          anyway. Secondly, I don't even know whether I'm a lama. From one
          perspective, it would appear that I am, but from another, perhaps not.
          I can't resolve this question myself, that's why I make no claim to be
          a lama. If you're a lama, then you need to have students, that's how
          it is. I've always maintained, however, that I don't have any
          students.
        </p>
        <p>
          So this is who I am. I've always known what positive actions are and
          what negative actions are, since the age of four. This isn't because
          I'm a special person of any sort, it has nothing to do with me. It is
          thanks to my parents, and everyone else who helped look after me when
          I was young, because they were all such kind, genuine Dharma
          practitioners. They are the reason that, since I was a child, I know
          something about the workings of karma. I can't remember a single time
          when I killed a sentient being, even a tiny insect. I might have
          killed two or three ants while I was playing, but even that I'm not
          sure of.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've always had an appreciation of the Dharma. I've received teachings
          from fifty-four different teachers, which is quite a lot. Therefore,
          I've received many teachings. The point of receiving teachings is to
          practise them – if you don't, they're useless. To practise them, it's
          necessary to be clear about what practice is. In my case, however, I
          kept on receiving one teaching after another, so much so that I ended
          up not knowing what to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're told to drink the ocean or eat a pile of food as high as a
          mountain, it's quite a tough challenge, you're facing a real problem.
          This is what it's like when you receive many different teachings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each teaching that we receive is greater than the previous one. The
          practitioner, however, is just one person, who needs to put the
          teachings into practice. And the practitioner is a mere human being,
          not a computer. A computer can absorb the entire Kangyur and Tengyur
          and every other teaching ever given, but it doesn't work like that for
          us. Therefore, in my own case, I ended up not knowing what I should do
          or practise.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to investigate this situation and came to a firm conclusion,
          which is what I want to share with you now, Harry. Whether or not you
          choose to follow what I say is up to you, it doesn't make the
          slightest difference to me!
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin with, you need to ask yourself the question: do you want to
          be a Dharma practitioner, or not? There are seven billion people on
          this planet but very few of them are Dharma practitioners, and even
          less, practitioners of Tibetan Buddhism. Dharma practitioners are
          probably seen by most people as being slightly crazy. It's true that
          most of them don't look very sane. I think it's important that you
          reflect carefully on this question and come to a conclusion. Chances
          are you will decide that the best option for you is to become a Dharma
          practitioner. I'm quite sure this is the conclusion that you'll reach.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Dharma practitioner needs to practise the Dharma. For that, he or
          she needs to follow a particular tradition, of which there are many. I
          think the choice we have all made is to practise the Secret Mantra
          Vajrayana.
        </p>
        <p>
          To practise the Vajrayana, you first need to train in the
          preliminaries in order to prepare yourself. I'm not talking about
          accumulating the outer and inner preliminaries here, rather that you
          start by developing renunciation for samsara. Without renunciation, it
          is impossible to practise the Dharma. This is because we practise the
          Dharma in order to be liberated from samsara and this has to be based
          on a sense of renunciation.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you have renunciation, you have an aspiration – the wish to be
          free from samsara. Then you need some knowledge: you need to know how
          you can become free from samsara, the path that leads to that freedom.
          To cross the ocean, you need a boat, otherwise you'll never reach the
          other side.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you've acquired this knowledge, you'll need to cultivate
          compassion. If you don't have compassion, the Vajrayana that takes the
          fruition as the path is groundless. There are many different types of
          compassion, greater and lesser. Even if you don't have a particularly
          big compassion, you at least need to have compassion for yourself,
          since you are a sentient being lost in samsara. From there, you can
          extend this feeling to others. If you don't have any compassion for
          yourself, yet pretend to have compassion for others, all your mouthing
          of “Oh poor thing” will just be a pack of lies.
        </p>
        <p>
          You then need to realize emptiness. If you realize emptiness
          correctly, you're a buddha, since once you fully realize emptiness,
          you no longer fall back into samsara. You see that the whole of
          samsara, whose nature is suffering, is like a mere dream or illusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most profound way we can realize emptiness, which is available to
          us now, is the Secret Mantra Vajrayana, which is rich in skilful
          methods and easier than other paths. These methods involve deity
          meditation. They're only methods, not the ultimate nature – on the
          ultimate level there is no deity to accomplish. But at our level, we
          need deity practice and these deities comprise the three roots: the
          lama, the root of blessing; the yidam, the root of accomplishment; and
          the dakinis and dharma protectors, the root of enlightened activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are so many different deities it can be very confusing for us.
          It's like when you take a child to a big department store full of toys
          to buy her a present, and she doesn't know which one to choose. At
          least, that's what happened when I went with my granddaughter!
        </p>
        <p>
          We become just like that when we have so many different deities to
          choose from. We think we have to practise them all. If we really
          thought about it, however, we'd realize that all the different deities
          are in essence the same. Whether we accomplish a peaceful deity or a
          wrathful deity, it's the same, we attain the supreme and ordinary
          siddhis. Of course, we're not practising for the ordinary siddhis,
          we're aiming for the supreme accomplishment. The ordinary siddhis are
          just a by-product of Dharma practice that can help us to move closer
          towards accomplishing the supreme siddhi. For example, if you want a
          good car, then you need money. The main aim of Dharma practice is the
          supreme siddhi.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you really think about it, you'll realize that in order to reach
          the supreme siddhi, there's no greater approach than that of the Great
          Perfection, as found in the 6,400,000 tantras of Dzogpachenpo. These
          teachings are presented in great detail but they all come down to just
          one point: mind is such that its essence is empty, its nature is
          cognisant, and the union of these two is unimpeded appearance. These
          three aspects are the dharmakaya, sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya, which
          are not external to you, but inside you, as the nature of your mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          How can you know this? You need to be introduced to this nature by the
          guru, when he says, for example, 'Do not fabricate thoughts, look
          directly into your mind and rest in that recognition.'
        </p>
        <p>
          You've received many Dzogchen teachings, Harry, but it's not quite
          that simple, is it? You haven't recognized this yet. You may have
          heard these instructions many times, but the recognition of the nature
          of mind still escapes you.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what should you do? You need to accumulate merit. If you
          accumulate merit and eliminate obscurations, the recognition will
          come.
        </p>
        <p>
          What do we mean by 'accumulation'? We mean the accumulation of merit
          that involves reference points and the accumulation of wisdom that is
          without reference.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's fine to focus mainly on the accumulation of wisdom, which is
          meditation without reference point. But if you don't know how to
          meditate, how to rest in that space, how will you accomplish this
          accumulation? Just sitting in the meditation posture alone won't be
          enough. You need to know how to meditate. But you don't.
        </p>
        <p>
          What do you need to know in order to meditate? What should you do? The
          more you study, the worse it gets, because thoughts only obscure the
          nature of mind. Studying won't lead you to primordial wisdom. It'll
          actually make things worse, because you'll end up having all sorts of
          thoughts such as 'It is like this, it is not like that...'
        </p>
        <p>
          There's nothing you can do. Even if you offer ten thousand kilos of
          gold to your teacher, he won't be able to give it to you. If the lamas
          were capable of this, they'd introduce the nature of mind to everyone.
          But it doesn't work like that, it needs to come from you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may think that this is never going to happen, but it's not true,
          it is possible. There are so many examples we can read about in the
          biographies of practitioners.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might then ask, 'So what should I do?' There are many different
          sadhanas but amongst them all, the practice of the lama is considered
          to be the greatest. If you practise and accomplish the lama, you will
          also accomplish the yidam and dakini. When you receive an empowerment,
          the lama introduces you to the yidam and gives you the transmission of
          that deity. Without the lama, you cannot connect with the yidam. It is
          the same for the dakini and dharma protector. If you accomplish the
          lama, then you accomplish everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are hundreds of different lama sadhanas, such as Guru Rinpoche
          practices with the lama as dharmakaya, the lama as sambhogakaya, and
          the lama as nirmanakaya. There are many other lama sadhanas which
          focus on other gurus as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of all the lama sadhanas, however, the most important one is the Seven
          Line Prayer from Guru Chöwang. Actually, the practice comes from Guru
          Rinpoche – Guru Chöwang was Guru Rinpoche himself. The termas he
          revealed include the Seven Line Prayer, the innermost practice for
          accomplishing the guru.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my own personal opinion, it's the most important practice of all.
          This is the result of my many years of investigation and reflection.
          As the text says, it is intended for people in future times (i.e.
          people like you and me) who like the Dharma, but who don't really know
          how to practise it, or are too lazy to apply what they do know. They
          are 'fortunate', as the text says, but still have obstacles.
        </p>
        <p>
          What should people like us do then? We need to take refuge in the
          Lotus-born Guru. How do we take refuge in Guru Rinpoche? We cannot buy
          him out with dollars. We cannot have a conversation with him. We
          cannot invite him to a restaurant. So what should we do? The answer is
          in the text itself, which says: 'Take yourself to an isolated place.'
        </p>
        <p>
          An isolated place is somewhere that is not busy with people; as it is
          said, 'without people during the day and gods and spirits at night'.
          You need to go to a place like that and stay there. Note that the text
          doesn't say that you should stay there for one hour or for five
          minutes. You should stay there for as long as you can. It could be for
          just a second, or the rest of your life. Whatever the case, you need
          to stay in a quiet place.
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll be able to do that if you reflect on impermanence and feel a
          deep sense of melancholy. As I've just told you, you need to develop a
          weariness of impermanence and samsara, otherwise it's never going to
          work out. You need to feel a disgust for samsara and seek whatever
          methods there are to be free of it. You should come to the point where
          you ask yourself, 'What do I need to do?' The answer is: You need to
          realize emptiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          How can you realize emptiness? By taking refuge and praying to the
          lama. Therefore the text says, 'Whether in happiness or in sorrow,
          have total trust and confidence in [Guru Rinpoche]', and 'rely on
          [him] completely, heart and soul'. There are many other sources of
          refuge, such as the three jewels or the three roots. Here you need to
          trust that they are all embodied within Guru Rinpoche. There's no
          problem with that, for people like you [Harry] and me. That's all we
          need. Realize that, 'Every kind of refuge, all your hopes, are all
          fulfilled and complete within me, the Guru of Orgyen.' In other words,
          Guru Rinpoche is enough. Likewise think that in all situations,
          whether in happiness or in sorrow, Guru Rinpoche knows exactly what is
          happening to you, and cares for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text then says that you don't need to bother with deity
          meditation, making offerings, offering praise, reciting mantras, and
          so on – you don't need any of this. 'Simply let devotion flood your
          body, speech and mind. And pray, pray with these seven lines', which
          are the Seven Line Prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mipham Rinpoche wrote an extensive commentary to the Seven Line
          Prayer, which I have already explained. Guru Chöwang's text instructs
          you to pray by reciting these seven lines. It only says to pray, it
          doesn't say how much: 'Pray in this way, over and over again. Create a
          feeling of yearning and longing so intense that tears spring from your
          eyes.' Once you have a feeling of devotion that is so strong that all
          your thoughts suddenly cease, like a stone hitting the floor, 'Then
          leave everything as it is. Clear and awake, focused and undistracted,
          look within.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The text adds, 'Children of mine who pray like this, it goes without
          saying that they will have my protection, for they will be the sons
          and daughters of the buddhas of past, present and future.'
        </p>
        <p>
          That's the best method. And you can do it anytime – when you wake up,
          when you go to the toilet, when you eat... any time. You can go to
          your garden or to a park, relax for a moment, and then pray to him. It
          could equally be by an ocean or on top of a mountain – no matter what
          you do, if you follow these instructions and pray to him, it is one
          hundred percent certain that one day you will realize emptiness, even
          if we can't exactly say how.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you look into the lives of the masters of the past, you'll see that
          this can happen in all sorts of ways and in all kinds of situations.
          We don't know how it will happen, but it is one hundred percent
          certain that it will happen. And when it happens, you will know. We
          can see when our mind has changed, no one else will know but you. Only
          you can see your own mind. We can't put our minds inside a machine
          which then tells us what we think.
        </p>
        <p>So, do this practice!</p>
        <p>
          It's very easy and very beneficial. You don't need to make tormas, you
          don't need anything else. You know how to recite the Seven Line
          Prayer, right? You need to study it well. Learning about it is not
          useful on its own, you need to put it into practice. Even if you
          receive one thousand Guru Rinpoche empowerments, you only need recite
          this one prayer which is the essence of them all. And if you practise
          Guru Rinpoche, all the yidams, dakinis, and Dharma protectors, are
          also included. Doesn't the Seven Line Prayer say, 'surrounded by many
          hosts of dakinis'?
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, you should recite a minimum of one hundred Seven Line
          Prayers each day, which is very easy. It only takes about seven
          minutes.
        </p>
        <p>Do you understand?</p>
        <p>
          The essence of the Seven Line Prayer is the Vajra Guru Mantra. All the
          sadhanas of the three root deities are contained in the lama practice.
          Lama practice condenses the many thousands of sadhanas found in the
          Treasury of Precious Termas, which are sadhanas of the three roots.
          All the lama sadhanas are themselves condensed into the Seven Line
          Prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, do this Seven Line Prayer! At least one hundred and eight times
          every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          And always keep an image of Guru Rinpoche with you, as a support for
          your prayers. If you don't have one, it's fine too. The lama is
          indivisible from your own mind. When people hear this, they usually
          feel scared and uncomfortable. But there's nothing to be afraid of,
          because everything is the natural expression of emptiness. All
          appearances arise as the natural display of emptiness – it's the same
          in this instance, if you recognize it. If you don't recognize it, then
          you have thoughts such as, 'How can an ordinary person like me be the
          same as Guru Rinpoche!', which makes you very uncomfortable. That fear
          will prevent you from attaining enlightenment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given the way things function at our level, we should create positive
          interdependent circumstances by carrying an image of Guru Rinpoche
          with us. The teachings also instruct us to have a kapala and a vajra,
          but they are already included in the Guru Rinpoche image, since he
          always holds them.
        </p>
        <p>
          So recite the Seven Line Prayer, and perform the tenth day offering.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a tsok practice associated with the Seven Line Prayer which
          was composed by Mipham Rinpoche. You can do the simple version or do
          the practice more elaborately, as you wish. There are different ways
          the practice can be done. When people say, 'This is my tradition, that
          is theirs', it shows they've never really heard about the genuine
          view.
        </p>
        <p>
          In any case, you need to rely one hundred percent on Guru Rinpoche, to
          have complete trust in him.
        </p>
        <p>Do you understand? This is easy, isn't it?</p>
        <p>This is really important.</p>
        <p>
          I have spent 67 years thinking about this and this is the conclusion
          that I've come to. The teachings of the Buddha are extremely vast.
          When you become a fully ordained monk, you have 258 rules that you
          need to follow, which can be quite daunting. In one way, however, it's
          perhaps not so difficult, because it has nothing to do with the mind,
          they're just rules that govern your body and speech. Based on
          ordination, you can eventually attain the state of arhat-hood,
          although it's not too sure when that will happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there's the Mahayana vehicle of the bodhisattvas, in which you
          need to meditate on bodhichitta in aspiration and action. 'Bodhichitta
          in aspiration' is basically having a good heart and thinking, 'The
          buddhas and bodhisattvas of the past have done great things, I will do
          the same.' 'Bodhichitta in action' is to put this aspiration into
          action by applying yourself to the six paramitas. This approach,
          however, takes three countless aeons before you become enlightened.
          Beyond that, there's the approach of Secret Mantra Vajrayana which
          brings enlightenment within sixteen lifetimes. Here, you need to
          meditate on kyerim and dzogrim. What's the point of all these
          different practices? To realize emptiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have been discussing the approach of Dzogchen, the teachings that
          speak of 'liberation through seeing', 'liberation through hearing',
          'liberation through touching', and 'liberation through remembering.'
          The Dzogchen teachings themselves don't talk about the next life. They
          say that those of superior capacity will be liberated in this life,
          those of middling capacity will be liberated in the bardo, and those
          of lesser capacity will go to a nirmanakaya pure land and be liberated
          there.
        </p>
        <p>
          This sounds not too bad, but first you need to realize the nature of
          your mind, and no matter how hard you might try, that realization
          doesn't come very easily. Therefore, you need to take refuge. For
          that, Guru Rinpoche is your best option. Think, 'I need to have this
          realization, but can't get there by myself. So, I'll pray to Guru
          Rinpoche, confident that he knows and cares for me.'
        </p>
        <p>
          We could of course simply rest in meditation, but then we'd need to
          know how to do that. If you know how to, that's fine, but if you
          don't, what are you meditating on? Practice manuals such as the Yeshe
          Lama say that you start with direct introduction to the natural state,
          which is likened to opening the eyes of a blind person. You need to
          have been introduced to and to have recognized the nature of your
          mind, before you meditate. Then you apply the four choshaks, the 'four
          ways of leaving things as they are', and continue with tögal practice.
          It's quite difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's why I'm suggesting that you may wish to consider praying to
          Guru Rinpoche. Because if you do that, it's one hundred percent
          guaranteed that one day you will recognize the nature of your mind. In
          the unimaginable event that this doesn't happen in this lifetime,
          there's no doubt that at the very least you'll be reborn on the Copper
          Coloured Mountain. Everyone who focuses on praying to Guru Rinpoche
          will be reborn on the Copper Coloured Mountain when they die. Someone
          who is reborn there doesn't have ordinary thoughts, all their thoughts
          dissolve the moment they meet Guru Rinpoche. It is like when the sun
          shines the darkness disappears.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, it would be better for you to pray to Guru Rinpoche. That's
          what I think. I've never said this to anyone before, but I'm telling
          you. Others can listen if they wish, since it can only benefit them
          and certainly won't bring any harm.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish to clarify one point, though. I'm sure some people will say:
          'In his teaching Tulku Orgyen Tobgyal says that you only need the
          Seven Line Prayer. You don't need ngöndro, you don't need the main
          sadhana practices, you don't need anything else. That's what he says!'
        </p>
        <p>
          What I've shared here is an individual practice instruction, key
          points that Harry needs to apply. You can do other practices as much
          as you like, there's nothing wrong with that! You can do one thousand
          drupchens. Any practice is okay. What I'm talking about here is what
          you should focus your mind on. Otherwise, all the practices that
          you've done throughout your life won't help when you come to die.
          You'll be lost, thinking 'I've done so many practices, but what's the
          main point, what's the heart of it all?' It's like when you go to
          Delhi airport, it's so big, you don't know where to go. Whatever we do
          these days, we always need to make a plan. So, this is the plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've investigated all of this carefully and this is the conclusion
          that I've come to. It's a personal matter, though; you need to come to
          your own decision. You don't need to talk about it with others.
          Nowadays, when people know just one small piece of information they
          feel an overwhelming urge to talk to everyone about it.
