          Excerpt from Jamgon Mipham's (Mipham the Great's) commentary on the
          Seven Line Prayer titled "White Lotus":
        </S.PageHeader>
        <p>
          In the beginning, we can use the Seven-Line Prayer as a part of the
          guru-yoga practice. It establishes the favorable conditions for the
          actualization of primordial wisdom. Then, with the help of a fully
          qualified teacher, we should gain a clear understanding of the
          essential points of the common paths of skillful means and liberation,
          and of the ultimate and swift path of the Great Perfection. Next, we
          should make these the heart of our practice and meditate with
          diligence. This is how to gain certainty in the view; as explained in
          the conclusive pith instructions; and it is how one accomplishes the
          level of vidyadhara.
        </p>
        <p>
          With an irreversible faith in Guru Rinpoche, considering him the
          embodiment of all refuges, we should meditate upon him, visualizing
          him above the crown of our heads, praying to him intensely with the
          seven vajra verses [of the Seven-Line Prayer]. From the body of the
          Guru, there flows a stream of amrita (nectar of immortality), which
          cleanses away all of our illnesses, and all evil forces to which we
          have fallen victim, as well as all sins, defilements, and sufferings
          of body, speech and mind. All these negativities leave us in the form
          of pus, blood, insects, smoky-colored liquids, and various other
          impurities. Finally, like salt dissolving into water, our body melts
          into a pure liquid, which falls into the gaping mouths of Yama–the
          lord of death–and all the other evil forces and spirits beneath the
          earth to whom we owe karmic debts, so that these creditors are wholly
          satisfied. All evil and karmic debts are thus cleansed and dissolve
          into emptiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we should meditate on our bodies as being the luminous body of
          the yidam deity to whom we feel an affinity, and we should consider
          that Guru Rinpoche, visualized above the crown of our heads, descends
          into the center of the eight-petalled lotus of our hearts and mingles
          in a single taste with the indestructible essence-drop. We should then
          remain in a state of meditative equipoise in the primordial wisdom of
          great bliss.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the post-meditation period, we should consider that everything that
          appears is a pure buddhafield peopled by deities. We should use the
          activities of eating, walking, and sitting as part of the practice,
          considering them as offerings, circumambulation, and so on,
          respectively. When we go to bed, we should visualize the teacher in
          the center of our hearts and practice accordingly. Thus in all our
          daily conduct, we should endeavor in the practice in a constant,
          uninterrupted stream, making a virtue of everything we do.
        </p>
        <p>
          We should visualize Guru Rinpoche in the sky in front of us and pray
          to him, making offerings and praises. This is the way to receive the
          blessings of his body, speech, and mind. Such prayers are of the
          highest importance. For, generally speaking, all the perfect qualities
          of the upper realms and the ultimate excellence of Buddhahood manifest
          when we follow a teacher. This is particularly true of the realization
          of the profound path, which depends entirely on the reception of the
          teacher's blessings. As it is said,
        </p>

          <p>The ultimate and coemergent wisdom</p>
          <p>
            Comes only through the gathering of merit and the cleansing of
            faults
          </p>
          <p>And from the blessings of accomplished gurus. </p>
          <p>To seek it elsewhere—you should understand—is folly. </p>
          <p>And, </p>
          <p>Moreover it is coemergent and ineffable.</p>
          <p>You find it nowhere else</p>
          <p>Except through the timely teachings of the guru</p>
          <p>And by the virtue of your merit. Know this well. </p>

          In order to actualize the highest primordial wisdom, we should study
          the texts of the sutras and tantras, together with their commentaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular, we should familiarize ourselves with the pith
          instructions that introduce directly and nakedly the ultimate
          primordial wisdom, the union of emptiness and appearance. It is by
          such means that we will be able to dispel all doubts regarding view.
          Then, by exerting ourselves according to our understanding and
          experience, either on the path of skillful means or on the path of
          liberation, we will reap the fruit of both now and ultimately.
