It also\n          functions as a method to awaken one’s own primordial wisdom-mind\n          according to the profound path of Ati Yoga. Although Padmasambhava is\n          a historical figure who’s known for establishing the Dharma in the\n          land of Tibet, removing all obstacles and training his heart\n          disciples; it’s also understood that he achieved a miraculous state\n          beyond death through which he can spontaneously benefit all those who\n          address him with heartfelt devotion. The Seven-Line Prayer is\n          universally known as the best means with which to do so.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          One special revealer of Padmasambhava’s hidden treasure teachings in\n          the 20th century, widely considered to be both his emanation and\n          regent, was Kyabje Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje Rinpoche (1904-1987).\n          Dudjom Rinpoche’s own son, heart disciple and lineage heir known as\n          Dungse Shenphen Dawa Norbu Rinpoche, in the years prior to his\n          Mahaparinirvana in 2018, often repeated this heartfelt advice to many\n          of his disciples:\n        </p>\n        <S.EmphasizedParagraph>\n          The most important activity to help dispel imminent global obstacles\n          to peace and harmony, as well as environmental problems, disease and\n          instability, is to recite and accumulate the Seven-Line Prayer.\n        </S.EmphasizedParagraph>\n        <p>\n          At the time when Rinpoche last spoke of this in early 2018, he\n          increased the number he felt would be able to shift our world’s\n          destructive course from one billion recitations to twenty one billion\n          (21,000,000,000). The implication was that the negative potentials had\n          gained so much momentum that it would require this immense number to\n          turn the tide. Clearly this will require a global effort!\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Since up until now there has not been enough of an outreach, the\n          current count is at almost 10 million. Although there is still a long\n          way to go to achieve 21 billion, if everyone joins in with joyful\n          diligence it is certain that we can accomplish our goal.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Each person who joins a vast collective accumulation like this—no\n          matter the amount they contribute—gathers the same merit as if they\n          had achieved the total on their own.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          So let’s use this time when millions of us in many countries are\n          forced to stay at home wisely, to progress in this accumulation for\n          our own protection and for everyone’s benefit.

The reason why this prayer comes so often is because at\n          the very moment Guru Rinpoche was conceived, in a lake in the\n          North-West corner of Uddiyana, realization was achieved\n          simultaneously. When this happened many millions upon millions of\n          dakinis sang this praise in one voice as a praise to the Lotus-born\n          Guru. These dakinis sang from three most sacred places. Therefore, it\n          has great blessings.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          To go just briefly through these lines, it says that: ‘being born in\n          the North-West corner of the country of Uddiyana, in a heart-center of\n          a lotus, endowed with the most marvelous attainments, you are known as\n          The Lotus-Born Guru, surrounded by many hosts of dakinis countless in\n          number, I will follow in your footsteps’. This is basically what it\n          means.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          This Seven-Line Prayer should not be considered as just another\n          supplication or invocation prayer. Instead it should be understood to\n          be the principle prayer calling for Guru Rinpoche which itself carries\n          tremendous blessings. Due to the power of the essence of this prayer\n          and the blessings it holds, when you have obstacles or hindrances, if\n          you recite it with confidence 100,000 times, normally these can be\n          immediately removed. Moreover, when I was young, I did this practice\n          several times and found that you can do 10,000 recitations a day,\n          which means that you can complete 100,000 recitations in ten days.\n          Since countless millions of dakinis have uttered this profound prayer\n          it has remarkable blessings. So, we should consider this not only as\n          an invocation but also a means to bring about the essential blessings\n          of Guru Rinpoche himself.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          My own root-teacher Gyurme Nyedun Wangpo, (otherwise known as, Podpong\n          Tulku or Zapong Tulku because he was coming from Za region), would\n          give this Seven-Line Prayer practice to all his students and disciples\n          to do. He would even give it to the mothers and children. Whoever came\n          to him to ask for teachings, he would simply say: “Just recite this\n          and have devotion while reciting this prayer. Recite this, that is\n          enough”. Therefore, my own root-teacher himself essentialized all\n          practice down to this Seven-Line Prayer. So, there is no need to get\n          bogged down in the complexities of the kyerim and things like that\n          which we don’t really understand. Simply doing this practice alone is\n          sufficient.\n        </p>\n      </Container>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default HHDudjomRinpoche;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport Container from \"react-bootstrap/Container\";\nimport Quote from \"components/Quote\";\nimport * as S from \"./styles\";\n\nfunction JamgonMipham() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Container>\n        <S.TeachingsHeader>\n          Excerpt from Jamgon Mipham's (Mipham the Great’s) commentary on the\n          Seven Line Prayer titled “White Lotus”:\n        </S.TeachingsHeader>\n        <p>\n          In the beginning, we can use the Seven-Line Prayer as a part of the\n          guru-yoga practice. It establishes the favorable conditions for the\n          actualization of primordial wisdom. Then, with the help of a fully\n          qualified teacher, we should gain a clear understanding of the\n          essential points of the common paths of skillful means and liberation,\n          and of the ultimate and swift path of the Great Perfection. Next, we\n          should make these the heart of our practice and meditate with\n          diligence. This is how to gain certainty in the view; as explained in\n          the conclusive pith instructions; and it is how one accomplishes the\n          level of vidyadhara.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          With an irreversible faith in Guru Rinpoche, considering him the\n          embodiment of all refuges, we should meditate upon him, visualizing\n          him above the crown of our heads, praying to him intensely with the\n          seven vajra verses [of the Seven-Line Prayer]. From the body of the\n          Guru, there flows a stream of amrita (nectar of immortality), which\n          cleanses away all of our illnesses, and all evil forces to which we\n          have fallen victim, as well as all sins, defilements, and sufferings\n          of body, speech and mind. All these negativities leave us in the form\n          of pus, blood, insects, smoky-colored liquids, and various other\n          impurities. Finally, like salt dissolving into water, our body melts\n          into a pure liquid, which falls into the gaping mouths of Yama–the\n          lord of death–and all the other evil forces and spirits beneath the\n          earth to whom we owe karmic debts, so that these creditors are wholly\n          satisfied. All evil and karmic debts are thus cleansed and dissolve\n          into emptiness.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Then we should meditate on our bodies as being the luminous body of\n          the yidam deity to whom we feel an affinity, and we should consider\n          that Guru Rinpoche, visualized above the crown of our heads, descends\n          into the center of the eight-petalled lotus of our hearts and mingles\n          in a single taste with the indestructible essence-drop. We should then\n          remain in a state of meditative equipoise in the primordial wisdom of\n          great bliss.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In the post-meditation period, we should consider that everything that\n          appears is a pure buddhafield peopled by deities. We should use the\n          activities of eating, walking, and sitting as part of the practice,\n          considering them as offerings, circumambulation, and so on,\n          respectively. When we go to bed, we should visualize the teacher in\n          the center of our hearts and practice accordingly. Thus in all our\n          daily conduct, we should endeavor in the practice in a constant,\n          uninterrupted stream, making a virtue of everything we do.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          We should visualize Guru Rinpoche in the sky in front of us and pray\n          to him, making offerings and praises. This is the way to receive the\n          blessings of his body, speech, and mind. Such prayers are of the\n          highest importance. For, generally speaking, all the perfect qualities\n          of the upper realms and the ultimate excellence of Buddhahood manifest\n          when we follow a teacher. This is particularly true of the realization\n          of the profound path, which depends entirely on the reception of the\n          teacher’s blessings.

Then Rinpoche speaks.</p>\n        <p>Now I have to turn that wheel of dharma.</p>\n        <p>\n          So you want to hear an explanation on the Seven Line Prayer, otherwise\n          known as the Invitation to Guru Rinpoche. Sometimes it is called the\n          Seven Line Prayer and sometimes it is called the Seven Line\n          Invitation. And, as you know, this is because there are seven lines of\n          verse. And so this is a supplication, a prayer to Guru Rinpoche, an\n          invitation bringing forth, inviting Guru Rinpoche. And so really in\n          terms of a very good, extensive explanation on this, I do not have one\n          to give. But Mipham Rinpoche himself composed a very extensive\n          commentary on the Seven Line Prayer &mdash; 50 pages of outer, inner,\n          secret, and super-secret explanations from the point of these four\n          levels or sections. He gives a very detailed commentary on the inner\n          meaning of the Seven Line Prayer from these four different levels of\n          understanding. But for us now with me here, I will not be able to give\n          you an explanation tantamount to that in the short amount of time we\n          have. And even if we had the text here, maybe I&rsquo;d be able to\n          read through the text and go over it with you. But if you really want\n          an extensive commentary, then my mouth probably wouldn&rsquo;t be able\n          to do all the talking for this one day. But I will speak a little bit\n          about it in any case. And so please, all of you, listen with a pure\n          and genuine intention of bodhicitta.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so the Seven Line Invitation then is the very same prayer that in\n          the celestial pure lands, khach&ouml;, celestial pure lands of the\n          dakinis... Then the mamos and dakinis, when they gather on the holy\n          days, like Guru Rinpoche Day, which is the tenth lunar day, or the\n          twenty-fifth day... and then perform tsok. They offer a ganachakra\n          feast together. And it is this verse that they use to summon Guru\n          Rinpoche to invite him to the feast. But Guru Rinpoche doesn&rsquo;t\n          have to come and go like an ordinary person. However, spontaneously\n          and naturally he makes his presence known. So he actually appears\n          there in the context and the presence of the feast when the dakinis\n          and mamos are then reciting this Seven Line Invitation, this\n          supplication to Guru Rinpoche. And so this is called the Vajra Seven\n          Lines because it is recited by the dakinis. This is the same verse\n          that they use to invite Guru Rinpoche to come to their feast offering.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so then the dakinis will sing. They will chant this prayer to a\n          very powerful and moving melody, beautiful melody. And then with this\n          they will invite Guru Rinpoche. And so in the same way then for us\n          then on the tenth day, the twenty-fifth day, the holy days, and also\n          at any time and in any situation, whenever we recite the Seven Line\n          Prayer to a beautiful sound and melody with single- pointed faith and\n          devotion in Guru Rinpoche, then when we do this, Guru Rinpoche\n          actually does come. He actually appears. Whether or not we&rsquo;re\n          reciting it together in the context of a ganachakra, a tsok offering,\n          or whether it&rsquo;s our general regular ongoing prayer... whenever\n          and at any time that you recite the Seven Line Prayer, you are\n          actually invoking Guru Rinpoche. And if you do so with faith and\n          devotion, single-pointed, Guru Rinpoche does in fact actually appear.\n          But because of our impure perception, we may not be able to sense it.\n          We cannot see him with our ordinary eyes. So some people may be\n          likened to think that maybe he doesn&rsquo;t really come because you\n          can&rsquo;t see him. But it isn&rsquo;t like that. He does come.\n          Whether or not we see him or not depends upon our level of our view,\n          our pure view or not. Because some people may not recognize... they\n          may not know that he&rsquo;s actually appearing there because they are\n          still seeped in the impure view or impure perception. We cannot see\n          him with our regular eyes, but he does in fact really come.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so also in India a long, long time ago there were two major\n          institutes or temples of learning for Buddhist studies, which were\n          extremely prestigious and filled with incredible scholars and masters,\n          incredible panditas. And then there came a time at the one temple, one\n          of the main temples, in which most of the more skilled scholars and\n          panditas had faded away and there were only a few remaining. And then\n          they began to be under siege or under threat of the non-Buddhist...\n          kind of rival groups who belonged to different traditions. And there\n          were the heretic groups who wished to, by means of debate, win over\n          the institute and take it over under the context of their rule. And so\n          they challenged the Buddhist panditas left in this institute to a\n          debate. And because these were great scholars, great masters, they\n          didn&rsquo;t really know how to respond. Because they knew that if\n          they didn&rsquo;t respond with the greatest answer and they\n          weren&rsquo;t really up to par, then... They were these great masters.\n          How could they allow themselves to be defeated?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so being under this kind of situation, all of the panditas one\n          night were visited by a wisdom dakini who came to them and said to\n          each one, &ldquo;Well, it is true that if you try it on your own you\n          will not be able to defeat these heretical groups merely on your own\n          abilities. You will not be able to defeat them. They will defeat you\n          in debate. And so if you want to defeat them and save your institute,\n          then you must invite Guru Rinpoche from the pure land to come and help\n          you.&rdquo; And so she explained to them how to do this.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          So they went to the top of the roof of their institute, the temple,\n          the university. And there they arranged a vast and extensive offering\n          of tsok, a feast offering. And then they all sang single- pointedly to\n          a haunting melody almost like with one voice, in unison calling Guru\n          Rinpoche with the Seven Line Prayer that the wisdom dakini told them\n          to recite. And so then here they were sitting on the roof gathered\n          together inviting Guru Rinpoche with the Seven Line Prayer, playing\n          the cymbals with the incense lit and with the haunting, beautiful\n          melody in one single voice, in unison. And Guru Rinpoche did actually\n          appear there. He actually came. And when he came, then he went ahead\n          and helped them. He defeated all of the heretic groups. And so he was\n          able to annihilate their argument. And so then because of this then\n          the panditas were able to win the debate and thus save their\n          institute.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so the prayer begins &ldquo;HUNG Orgyen yul-gyi nup-jang\n          tsam.&rdquo; And so HUNG, as you know, is a seed syllable, a heart\n          seed life force or enlightened mind seed syllable. You see this a lot\n          in the beginning of mantras &mdash; HUNG or HRI, these seed syllable\n          letters. So whatever kind of yidam deity you are practicing or\n          whatever you are practicing out of the three roots, usually the seed\n          syllable of these deities or the guru is either HUNG or HRI, and so\n          forth. So HUNG is like the seed syllable, which is like the life force\n          or the seed syllable of the enlightened mind.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          So then &ldquo;Orgyen yul gyi nupjam tsam&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;On the\n          northwest border of the country of Orgyen.&rdquo; Orgyen is Uddiyana,\n          and I wouldn&rsquo;t know because I haven&rsquo;t actually been there\n          (I&rsquo;ve seen it), except that it&rsquo;s supposedly actually\n          traced back to Pakistan somewhere. I haven&rsquo;t been to Pakistan so\n          I can&rsquo;t verify that. But in any case Pakistan seems to be the\n          general area where Uddiyana is said to have originated and it is also\n          the place of King Indrabodhi, who was actually the one who came and\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          brought Guru Rinpoche when he found him there self-arisen in this\n          lotus flower and invited him back to his kingdom.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so then it continues &ldquo;On the northwest corner&rdquo; or\n          &ldquo;the northwest border.&rdquo; And so it is said that in this\n          area of Uddiyana there somewhere in Pakistan, then somewhere in the\n          northwest, in the very border between the north and the west was the\n          actual place where the lotus flower arose and where Guru Rinpoche then\n          took miraculous birth.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so India has four great rivers, four great bodies of water. And\n          the first one is called the Sindhu River, which is called so because\n          if you go down this river you see an area of water that is red in\n          color, like the sindhura color, like the sindhura root. And so it is\n          called Sindhura Lake because it is red in color. And then if you go\n          down to the edge of this body of water, it leads to almost like the\n          mouth of a huge, almost an ocean-like body of water, which is called\n          the Lake of Milk, the Milky Lake of the Southwest. And actually this\n          Milky Lake of the Southwest, in Tibetan called [Tso Omasin???]. The\n          Milky Lake of the Southwest was actually where Guru Rinpoche took\n          birth in the center of a lotus flower.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so it is also over... In this area there are a lot of naga beings\n          &mdash; nagas or serpent spirits. And the king of the nagas, named\n          Jokpo, his abode is under the water there. And so Guru\n          Rinpoche&rsquo;s lotus flower then... the stem of this lotus flower\n          was right above the very top or peak of the abode or celestial mansion\n          of the king of the nagas named Jokpo. That&rsquo;s there the basic\n          lotus flower was. So in the next line... So &ldquo;In the northwest\n          corner in the country of Orgyen in the pollen heart of a\n          lotus...&rdquo; And the pollen heart of the lotus literally is\n          described to be geographically over the residence where the King Jokpo\n          of the nagas resides.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so then Guru Rinpoche born there in the pollen heart of this lotus\n          flower... Then the way this occurred is that in the western pure land,\n          the Lord Protector Buddha Amitabha emanated out rays of red light or\n          emanated out a red HRI syllable from his heart and rays of red light,\n          which then manifested a lotus flower in the center of which is like\n          the very pollen heart, like the pistil of the lotus flower. And in the\n          pollen heart of this lotus flower, then the great illustrious\n          Avolokitesvara, Chenrezig, then came and blessed the lotus flower. And\n          there arose the emanation of Guru Rinpoche. And so then Guru Rinpoche\n          took birth there upon this lotus flower.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And calling the land of Uddiyana somewhere in Pakistan is not saying\n          it&rsquo;s exactly down there on the map, but that it&rsquo;s\n          somewhere in this general area. And the reason it is called\n          &ldquo;Orgyen yul&rdquo; or the Land of Orgyen, the Land of Uddiyana,\n          is because this was the name of the place when Indrabodhi, the king,\n          was there in reign. And this is where he went when he found Guru\n          Rinpoche there and brought him back, and invited him to take over the\n          kingdom, invited him to the kingdom as the prince. And so that is why\n          it is called the Land of Orgyen. This is the area in which he was\n          invited &mdash; the empire.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          So most of you probably already know this story. And so I&rsquo;m\n          thinking, you know, most of you have already heard this and are\n          familiar with it... the story of how actually King Indrabodhi came to\n          find Guru Rinpoche and invite him back to the palace. But even if you\n          already know it, I&rsquo;m thinking that it&rsquo;s better that I do\n          say it anyway. It would be better to do that because otherwise\n          it&rsquo;d be like we&rsquo;re leaving out a very important part of\n          the story, kind of skipping over an important segment. So then I will\n          say it in any case.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And the story of King Indrabodhi, just in brief, is that the king was\n          incredibly powerful, had incredible sovereignty, and was incredibly\n          wealthy. And yet he could not seem to produce an heir. He could not\n          give birth to a son. And so this going on for a long time, he realized\n          that he needed to do something about this. And so he went to consult\n          with every single divination master in the land, every single\n          astrologer in the land, and asking all the diviners and astrologers\n          what they saw that he could do in order to produce an heir, to\n          actually produce a son. Then all of them said one thing, &ldquo;You\n          must give all of your wealth to the poor, you must give all of your\n          wealth to the needy, and you need to accumulate merit. So if you\n          gather accumulations by practicing generosity, giving everything you\n          have, whatever you can, to the needy and the poor, then you will be\n          able to have a son.&rdquo; And so then he also went to those who had\n          psychic powers, a clairvoyance, and they said the same thing. So every\n          single one who did divinations and everyone who did astrology, all the\n          masters who had clairvoyance, they all said with a single voice,\n          &ldquo;You must do this. Give everything you have to the poor and to\n          the village.&rdquo;\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so this is what he did. Because he was extremely wealthy, he had\n          many treasuries of wealth. He had incredible gold storehouses,\n          storehouses filled with gold and jewels and turquoise and the finest,\n          finest foods and so forth, the finest raiment. He had storehouses of\n          everything imaginable in his vast kingdom. And so in accordance with\n          the suggestions of all of these diviners and astrologers, then he went\n          and opened up all of storehouses and he basically just said,\n          &ldquo;Come forth!&rdquo; to all the of beggars. He just said\n          &ldquo;Come, all of you!&rdquo; He opened his doors for all of the\n          poor to just come and take whatever they wanted. And so what he did\n          was he simply offered whatever the person needed, whether the person\n          wanted clothes or the person needed food or they wanted money and\n          wealth, whatever it was. And he would give it like a wish-fulfilling\n          jewel from his treasuries. And so this he continued to do to hundreds\n          of thousands of beggars and poor.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so this went on for many years until eventually his vast\n          storehouses were emptied and all of his wealth was exhausted. But\n          still more beggars continued to come. And so feeling forlorn and\n          frustrated, he went to consult his ministers because he felt that,\n          &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t turn these people away, but I have nothing\n          left. I&rsquo;ve given everything I have. And so now I still\n          don&rsquo;t have a son. And it seems that all of this was just\n          pointless. And now I&rsquo;ve lost everything that I have.&rdquo; And\n          so being in this state of being disheartened, he consulted with all of\n          his ministers, and they were pretty much equally confused. They\n          didn&rsquo;t really have a good answer, and all they could say was,\n          &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s only one option left, you know. On the\n          other side of the vast lake, there is rumored to be a wish- fulfilling\n          jewel. And this wish-fulfilling jewel, if you&rsquo;re able to obtain\n          it at great cost, then once it&rsquo;s in your hands whatever you wish\n          for will be spontaneously granted. And so immediately the king devised\n          a plan to be able to go and actually find this wish-fulfilling jewel.\n          But all of the ministers tried to stop him and really suggested he did\n          not try to make this kind of perilous journey. But he still had a\n          plan. He was basically determined. And so he made the plan to go and\n          figure out a way to obtain this jewel.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so then when the king went to go and announce his decision to all\n          of the ministers that he was going to go and try to find this\n          wish-fulfilling jewel on the other side of the vast body of water,\n          then all of the ministers tried to get him not to go. They tried to\n          make him change his mind and they said, &ldquo;You really\n          shouldn&rsquo;t do this. You&rsquo;re already old. You&rsquo;re\n          advanced in age. It&rsquo;s extremely dangerous to try and go. And\n          there have been many, many journeyers, many who have tried to go in\n          the past. And not a single one has returned because they have either\n          been attacked by the wild serpent spirit being in the water, or they\n          have just been attacked by all of the dangers along the way on the\n          perilous journey. So it&rsquo;s extremely difficult to actually make\n          it there. And so it&rsquo;s best that you do not attempt that and thus\n          risk your life.&rdquo; But the king was adamant and he wasn&rsquo;t\n          going to listen to them.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so he announced to all of the subjects in the kingdom and tried to\n          find anyone who could say that they&rsquo;ve at least made that\n          journey and come back to tell about it. And there was only one old,\n          old man in the entire kingdom who had once been a ferryman and ferried\n          in a boat across the water. So he had been able to return. By now his\n          hair was white and he was seeped in old age, but he was the only one\n          who had ever been, who knew the way, who knew how to lead someone\n          there. And so he reluctantly told the king that, yes, he had been\n          there. And the king then asked him if he would be his boatman and\n          ferry him across the water. And the old man became very frightened,\n          and he really tried to dissuade the king from making him do this. He\n          said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very dangerous.&rdquo; And what he was\n          thinking was, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the king. You&rsquo;re the most\n          powerful and important man in the kingdom. And if I take you across\n          the river and I don&rsquo;t bring you back, the entire country&rsquo;s\n          going to be very upset with me.&rdquo;\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so thinking of this he was extremely scared for his life and for\n          the king&rsquo;s life. And he didn&rsquo;t trust the journey himself.\n          But the king had to give his command and there was no choice. He had\n          to listen. So the king tried to reassure him saying, &ldquo;Okay, as\n          long as you just do the job of carrying me across the water... Tell me\n          everything we need. I will make all the preparations from my side. And\n          then you just be the one to lead us, to take us along the water in the\n          boat.&rdquo; And so the old boatman then gave him all the instructions\n          of preparations needed to be made. And [he said], &ldquo;Okay,\n          we&rsquo;ll need this and you&rsquo;ll need this kind of thing. And\n          we&rsquo;ll need all of these materials.&rdquo; And so the king then\n          arranged for everything.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And finally bringing a retinue of 500 along with him in this boat,\n          then the king and 500 of his retinue went led by this old ferryman\n          across the water to fetch the wish-fulfilling jewel. And they\n          journeyed and journeyed. And it was an extremely long journey. They\n          had been journeying for over one month&rsquo;s time and still they had\n          more to go. And finally they were getting closer and closer to their\n          destination, to the island where the jewel resided. And so the old man\n          was the only one who was able to determine, who knew where the land\n          would be and what it looked like and how to recognize it.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Now also another aspect of this story is that the king was blind. He\n          didn&rsquo;t have working vision. But yet as a sign of the blessings\n          of this wish-fulfilling jewel, then even by coming into the vicinity\n          of the jewel, then one of his eyes restored its eyesight. And so all\n          of the a sudden the king was pointing at all of the different colored\n          mountains &mdash; the white, the yellow, and all of these different\n          mountain ranges that he could see on the horizon they were coming to\n          approach. And his retinue was absolutely flabbergasted and they said,\n          &ldquo;How is it that you can see this?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;I\n          don&rsquo;t know. My vision in this one eye...&rdquo; One of his eyes\n          had been restored to vision.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so then the old man finally found the exact land and where they\n          had to go. And so he said, &ldquo;Okay, now the rest of you wait. The\n          only one who can go to find this jewel has to have incredible merit,\n          really be a lucky person with good merit because there are many wild\n          animals. It&rsquo;s extremely dangerous, extremely perilous along this\n          area, so the only one who can really come must have tremendous merit.\n          So saying this, then the king said, &ldquo;Okay, well, I will\n          go.&rdquo;\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And they went to this place where the old man led them and then they\n          found this one structure like a building or a house. And there was a\n          golden vajra, kind of like a doorknocker, like a golden vajra\n          doorknocker. And they clapped the door. And then it was opened. And\n          they were told... Because in this area now, on this island, there were\n          tons and tons of jewels, all kinds of precious jewels like coral and\n          ruby and all kinds of things, anything you can desire. But they were\n          very directly instructed, &ldquo;Okay, do not take the wrong jewel.\n          Make sure... A girl will come, a very special, unusually unique girl\n          will come and appear. And when she appears, she will give you this\n          wish-fulfilling jewel. But do not mistake it. Do not go about picking\n          up another ordinary jewel and taking it back with you without\n          recognizing the wish-fulfilling jewel.&rdquo; And so doing as they\n          were instructed, then when the girl came and they actually got the\n          wish-fulfilling jewel then they felt a little bit relieved. So now\n          they could go ahead and they were told that, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re\n          allowed to pick up other jewels if you want because now you have the\n          wish-fulfilling jewel. So it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re\n          protected.&rdquo; But then the old man also said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t\n          take too much because we might sink the boat.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so then they gathered whatever jewels that they were to gather.\n          And as the king was walking back with the old man with the\n          wish-fulfilling jewel in his hands, then meanwhile at the edge, by the\n          actual foot of the lake then wandering around was the king&rsquo;s\n          kind of like secretary. His treasurer was like a merchant who acted as\n          the king&rsquo;s treasurer, one of his attendants. And he was\n          wandering around examining all of the beautiful flowers and the lake\n          and looking at the scenery. And all of a sudden he looked up and there\n          in the lake were all of these incredible, beautiful flowers. But then\n          there was one that was unlike all of the others, because all of the\n          others had already opened and bloomed. But this one was still the bud.\n          It had not quite opened yet. And also it was extremely beautiful and\n          it was encased and showering, emanating out all of these rainbows and\n          light rays. So it was inconceivably different than the others. And\n          seeing this kind of stupendous, unbelievable sight, then the treasurer\n          went to go and tell the king that something unusual is here. This\n          flower isn&rsquo;t like all of the others. And in addition to that,\n          then when he went to look back before he went to go and tell the king\n          what he found, then the flower began to open. The lotus flower opened\n          up and there in the center was an extremely beautiful, young boy, like\n          a magical boy who then took this miraculous birth in the center of\n          this flower.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          So then knowing that the king was on his way back, then the treasurer\n          went to go and tell the king to come and look at this to see what it\n          could be. But then he knew, of course the king couldn&rsquo;t see, so\n          he would have to just describe it to him. But then when he brought the\n          king with him, the king pointed and said, &ldquo;Wow! Look at this\n          incredible lotus flower with all of these light rays.&rdquo; And the\n          treasurer was surprised. He said, &ldquo;You can see that?!&rdquo; And\n          the king said, &ldquo;Yes, because now due to the power of the\n          blessings...&rdquo; First he got one eyesight restored, and now again\n          due to the blessings of Guru Rinpoche and the birth of Guru Rinpoche\n          now both of his eyes were restored to vision and he was able to behold\n          everything perfectly. And so then he realized that it was because of\n          all the many years that he had made offerings and practiced generosity\n          he had gained a great deal of merit, King Indrabodhi. And so for that\n          then he had been able to behold all of this incredible sight. And\n          there before him Guru Rinpoche in the form of this young boy was there\n          in the center of this miraculous lotus flower. And so then King\n          Indrabodhi in absolute amazement then invited the young boy to come\n          and be the prince, to be his son.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so then he actually brought the young boy, Guru Rinpoche, together\n          with the entire stem of the lotus flower and carried him. And then\n          they brought him back to the kingdom. And the king then also made an\n          announcement to all of his subjects and all of the people in the\n          kingdom and in the palace, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bringing back my son now\n          with me. I&rsquo;m bringing the heir to the throne, a prince, here.\n          And so now please get ready with the procession.&rdquo; And so they\n          had a huge procession with all of the cymbals and the music and all of\n          the incredible banquets to welcome this prince to the kingdom. And\n          there then Guru Rinpoche was instated within the palace of the king.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so if I didn&rsquo;t say this, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been okay.\n          So I had to tell you at least this much.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so then having brought... Guru Rinpoche invited him to the\n          kingdom. Then the king had fulfilled one of his wishes. Through this\n          wish-fulfilling jewel, he had found a son, an heir. And so then also,\n          through the wish-fulfilling jewel, he was able to fill all of his\n          treasuries. So praying, supplicating the jewel, then all of his\n          treasuries and storehouses that had been emptied were filled again.\n          And now he could give to the poor like never before. And so there was\n          even more to given than before &mdash; enough for all of the poor and\n          the needy.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so then Guru Rinpoche spent some time there maintaining his reign\n          over the kingdom as the prince. And then the deities came and told\n          him, &ldquo;Okay, now the time has come for you to renounce the world,\n          to renounce samsara, and to enact to the benefit of sentient beings.\n          Without renouncing the worldly samsara, you will not be able to\n          benefit beings. Thus now time has come to renounce the kingdom and to\n          go on your way to further your enactment of enlightened activities for\n          the benefit of beings.&rdquo; And so seeing this, then Guru Rinpoche\n          knew that he would have to renounce the kingdom by using skillful\n          means, some kind of strategy. He would not be able to just simply\n          leave. There would have to be a way that would allow him to leave the\n          kingdom in a way that would work. And so then he devised a plan.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Of course there are many different explanations and accounts of this,\n          but this is one story, one account. And so he went to the top of the\n          roof and he brought his staff, like his khatvanga or his staff. And\n          holding his staff over the top of the roof of the castle then he\n          dropped it. He let it drop so that it landed on a mara demon, which\n          actually destroyed the demon, liberating him. But at the same time it\n          broke a major law because here he was basically committing the act of\n          killing and dropping his staff. And so as he had broken one of the\n          major laws of the kingdom, that he himself was no exception, he also\n          had to fall under the perjury [sic] of the law. And so then all of the\n          ministers and all of the king... the father and the queen, the king\n          and the queen, they all came to figure out what the right course of\n          action would be. And of course they didn&rsquo;t want him to leave.\n          But there was either the choice of he was to be executed or sometime\n          terrible, some horrible punishment, or he was to be ostracized and\n          simply excommunicated, made to leave to the far, far reaches of the\n          borderland somewhere. And so because they couldn&rsquo;t bear the idea\n          of him being executed, then they banished him to the far outskirts of\n          this area, which was extremely dangerous. It was like a charnel ground\n          area. But actually this was perfect for Guru Rinpoche. He accomplished\n          his intention. And so now he freely left the kingdom then.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so this is how he was able to skillfully renounce the kingdom and\n          then go. And this is where there are many, many accounts of Guru\n          Rinpoche and how he lived, enacted his enlightened activities\n          throughout the fearful charnel grounds. And in this way then this is\n          how through skillful means he was able to escape or renounce the\n          kingdom. Now then there are further accounts of how he went to India\n          and manifested the attainment of all of the siddhis and\n          accomplishments, and then how he tamed countless beings and nestled\n          them into the dharma and liberated them through dharma.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And then finally he actually returned to the Land of Orgyen, the\n          kingdom of Indrabodhi. And there he turned the wheel of the dharma and\n          taught everyone there. Then it is the case that it is said that\n          every... it was almost as if the kingdom just became completely\n          emptied &mdash; null and void &mdash; because every single person\n          there who he taught the dharma to attained rainbow body. So then after\n          everyone attained rainbow body, it was like it was just left\n          abandoned. There was nobody left.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so this is the story of how Guru Rinpoche&rsquo;s... and this is\n          why it is the first of the Seven Line Prayer &ldquo;In the country of\n          Orgyen&rdquo; &mdash; because Orgyen was where he came, where he was\n          invited, where he demonstrated the activity of renouncing samsara,\n          renouncing the kingdom. And it&rsquo;s also where he returned later to\n          turn the wheel of dharma and where he ended up nestling all of the\n          subjects and all of the residents of Orgyen there into the dharma, and\n          thus emptying the entire kingdom because they all attained liberation,\n          rainbow body.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so then Guru Rinpoche displayed unimaginable, inconceivable\n          enlightened activities for the sake of the Buddha&rsquo;s teachings\n          throughout India and Tibet. And so part of the story of the life of\n          Guru Rinpoche is how he was, on more than one occasion, placed in\n          situations in which he was almost... there were attempted\n          assassinations. That is to say, he was tempted [sic] to be burnt alive\n          on a pyre. And so the first time this happened was in Zahor and the\n          second time was also in the Land of Orgyen because don&rsquo;t forget\n          that he himself had made himself so that he was banished from the\n          Kingdom of Orgyen. So when he came back, there were many who still had\n          a lot of skepticism and doubt. And so then there was an attempt on his\n          life to try and burn him alive in this giant pyre, this giant fire,\n          cremation fire. But then displaying countless miraculous activities,\n          then... In this case he had transformed the fire into a lake and then\n          people found him standing there in the midst of this self-arising\n          lotus flower. And so seeing this, then people had tremendous faith and\n          devotion arise for him. And it is in this way that he tamed the minds\n          of countless beings (through displaying miraculous activities) and\n          turned their minds to the dharma.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Now there are some places you can actually visit. In terms of where he\n          was exactly where he had transformed this fire into a lake, it used to\n          be that it was surrounded by some mountain regions and you could visit\n          it. But then there was a tremendous earthquake and so now you\n          can&rsquo;t see any more this exact area, so it&rsquo;s not visible.\n          But what is visible, what you can still see is you can go to actually\n          the Land of Orgyen to the very lake. And you can actually see the lake\n          where it is said that the lotus flower self-arose and there arose Guru\n          Rinpoche. So this is something that you can all actually see directly\n          with your own eyes, this very area and lake. And so this is the\n          meaning of these two lines &ldquo;On the northwest corner of the\n          country of Orgyen in the pollen heart of a lotus.&rdquo;\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          &ldquo;You attained marvelous, miraculous siddhis&rdquo; is the third\n          line &ldquo;yatsen chokgi ngodrup nyay.&rdquo; And so what this means\n          is that he demonstrated the attainment of the supreme and the common\n          siddhis, spiritual attainments. In fact once he took the miraculous\n          birth on the lotus flower, then the deities, all of the lamas, the\n          yidams, the dakinis, the three roots, sources of refuge, the buddhas,\n          and bodhisattvas filled the entire sky, all of space, and conferred\n          their blessings and empowerments. And in that very moment then he\n          manifested the attainment of sublime and common siddhis. And so that\n          is why it is said &ldquo;You have attained marvelous, most excellent\n          siddhis.&rdquo; &ldquo;Most excellent&rdquo; are supreme siddhis, the\n          supreme-most siddhis, and then the common siddhis as well. So he has\n          attained all the attainments, all the spiritual attainments.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And likewise &ldquo;kordu khandro mangpo kor,&rdquo; &ldquo;You are\n          surrounded by a retinue of many dakinis.&rdquo; Because even when he\n          first took birth in the center of this lotus flower, then all of the\n          many dakinis from the celestial realms, the pure lands, came and\n          circumambulated him and offered enormous, inconceivable feasts,\n          ganachakra feast offerings and celebration and so forth. And so that\n          is why he&rsquo;s always surrounded by a retinue of many dakinis.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so we should all try to see this place of Orgyen, where you can\n          still actually visibly see where the lake is and where the lotus\n          flower arose.\n        </p>\n        <p>Rinpoche speaks.</p>\n        <p>\n          And then the next line &ldquo;kyaykyi jaysu dakdrup kyi,&rdquo;\n          &ldquo;Following your footsteps, I shall practice.&rdquo; And so we\n          are praying, supplicating Guru Rinpoche. We are saying, &ldquo;I\n          supplicate you. I follow after you. I shall accomplish and actualize\n          you. And so I am praying to you.&rdquo; And we are asking him,\n          &ldquo;Please come to bestow your blessings. I supplicate to you to\n          come and bless us. Bestow your blessings upon me. Bestow your\n          blessings upon us.&rdquo; And so you&rsquo;re asking Guru Rinpoche to\n          appear and bless you.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And then finally you have the four words which is the actual mantra\n          recitation, &ldquo;GURU PEMA SIDDHI HUNG.&rdquo;\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so this prayer is not something that is newfangled. In fact this\n          prayer has been around for ages. It is an age-old prayer that is the\n          one... the very same prayer that began to flourish in the pure land of\n          khach&ouml; or the celestial pure land of the mamos and dakinis, which\n          is the very Vajra Seven Lines that they use to invite Guru Rinpoche,\n          to invoke his blessings. And so likewise in Tibet all of the termas,\n          that is the great hidden treasures that Guru Rinpoche then concealed\n          for future generations, all of these that... you will see them, the\n          ones that are revealed by the great treasure- revealers like Dorje\n          Lingpa, Sangye Lingpa, and so forth, all of these have within them as\n          a part of them the Seven Line Prayer. So you will find the Seven Line\n          Prayer in all of these termas, the treasures. And so it is... Of all\n          of the prayers of supplication to Guru Rinpoche, this one has the most\n          blessings and the most potency. There are many different supplication\n          prayers of Guru Rinpoche, but none has more blessings, none is as\n          all-encompassing as the Seven Line Prayer. And all the blessings of\n          all supplications are completely condensed into this single seven\n          lines, into this single prayer. And that is why it is called the Vajra\n          Seven Line Prayer, Dorje Tsigdun Sol-Deb.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so if you really recite this prayer from your heart, then\n          there&rsquo;s no way that you can avoid bringing Guru Rinpoche forth\n          and invoking him. So it&rsquo;s extremely powerful. And you should\n          practice it at all times continually. And when you do this\n          you&rsquo;re inviting... Like for example whenever we recite this\n          prayer, also as the Vajra Seven Line Invocation or Invitation, we are\n          actually inviting Guru Rinpoche, supplicating him to bless our mind\n          streams. And if you maintain this, if you really focus on the Seven\n          Line Prayer, then it is certain that the blessings will come. The\n          blessings of Guru Rinpoche will spring out and be born in your mind\n          stream. And so there&rsquo;s tremendous blessings of this practice.\n          And that is why we actually say in the verse &ldquo;chingyi lap-chir\n          sheksu sol,&rdquo; &ldquo;Please, Guru Rinpoche, come in order to\n          bestow blessings.&rdquo; And so it&rsquo;s actually in the words, the\n          supplication. We&rsquo;re invoking Guru Rinpoche.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so really give it your all and do your best in trying to maintain\n          the practice of Seven Line Prayer, the Seven Line Invocation of Guru\n          Rinpoche. And so if you are able to do this, a good kind of sadhana or\n          practice in which you can practice and accumulate the Seven Line\n          Prayer is by Mipham Rinpoche &mdash; the Shower of Blessings practice\n          by Mipham Rinpoche, which is concise, condensed. It&rsquo;s not too\n          much. Because if it&rsquo;s too much, then it becomes a problem for us\n          because we just have too much to recite. But then if it&rsquo;s too\n          short then that&rsquo;s also a problem. This is just the right length.\n          It&rsquo;s nice and concise and not too long, not too many words. And\n          so if you can all practice in the context of the Seven Line Prayer,\n          then there is great benefit in this. And particularly also, when you\n          do your tsok, your ganachakra feast offerings, this also has a very\n          short one-page tsok offering. So you can also accumulate your\n          ganachakra feast in the context of the sadhana of the Seven Line\n          Invocation of Guru Rinpoche. And if you want to practice this\n          together, recite it together in a group, that&rsquo;s great. And also\n          you can do it on your own as your own individual practice using the\n          Shower of Blessings. And so it&rsquo;s very good if you can do the\n          offerings of the tsok and ganachakra in the context of this practice.\n          I don&rsquo;t know if you have this text or not, but it is available\n          in English, so it would be good to recite that.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"c0 c2\"></p>\n        <p>\n          Now most importantly when you recite the Seven Line Invitation\n          Invocation of Guru Rinpoche, the most important thing depends upon\n          your faith. You have to have the faith which is known... the faith of\n          absolute confidence of the presence of Guru Rinpoche, which is often\n          known as the faith of surrender, the faith that you know, the faith\n          that feels that &ldquo;Whether I am high or low, whatever position I\n          am in, wherever I am and whatever my circumstance, Guru Rinpoche, you\n          know me. You are aware of me.&rdquo; And that kind of heart-felt\n          confidence and faith, the trust that surrenders to Guru Rinpoche, is\n          known as the faith of utter surrender, the utter trusting faith. And\n          when that kind of faith arises from the bottom of your heart, then\n          anybody can assert, can confidently tell you, &ldquo;Yes, the\n          blessings will definitely enter into your mind stream.&rdquo; But\n          without faith, then even if you go through many recitations with your\n          mouth of the Seven Line Prayer, there&rsquo;s no certainty that the\n          blessings will enter. Why? Because the doorway to the blessings\n          entering depends upon your faith and devotion. And so when your own\n          faith and devotion in Guru Rinpoche meets with the innate blessings of\n          the Seven Line Prayer, when these two factors come into confluence,\n          then there is blessings. Then the blessings can actually penetrate.\n          But you need to have one-pointed faith and devotion, single-pointed.\n          If you don&rsquo;t have faith...\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Of course there&rsquo;s many kinds of faith, that being said. There is\n          the lucid faith of admiration. There is the faith of desire that is\n          the desiring that desires to accomplish the state. Then there is the\n          faith of confidence and the faith that does not turn back &mdash;\n          irreversible faith. Out of these four types of faith, the most\n          important types are the faith of confidence, otherwise known as the\n          faith of trust, and the faith that is irreversible, the faith that\n          will never turn back. And the faith of confidence is like this kind of\n          faith, where you feel whether I am high or low, whether I am happy or\n          sad, no matter what, your mind is absolutely 100 percent convinced\n          &ldquo;Guru Rinpoche, you know you are fully aware of me and I\n          surrender to you.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s almost &ldquo;I am in your\n          hands.&rdquo; So this kind of faith... &ldquo;No matter what happens,\n          Guru Rinpoche, I have no one to rely on. I have no one to pray to. I\n          have no other hope, no other refuge besides you.&rdquo; That utter,\n          utter surrendering faith of confidence... And then coupled with the\n          faith that is irreversible, which means that no matter what happens,\n          whatever situation one is in, whether one is happy or sad, one can\n          never lose one&rsquo;s faith. One&rsquo;s faith is beyond the ability\n          to turn it. And one cannot have wrong view, cannot lose one&rsquo;s\n          faith. So one&rsquo;s faith is indestructible. When you get to that\n          kind of level of faith and you have both of these faiths, then the\n          blessings can definitely enter you. And so whether the blessings of\n          the practice come or not depends upon your faith. And so that is why\n          it is said, if you have confidence, if you have trust, the blessings\n          enter. If you have a mind free of doubts, your aims can be\n          accomplished.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Guru Rinpoche himself said, &ldquo;When you recite the Seven Line\n          Prayer, do so without any doubt, without any skepticism in your\n          mind.&rdquo; Because if you&rsquo;re doing the Seven Line Prayer and\n          then you have this sort of skeptical, dubious mind that wonders,\n          &ldquo;Oh, is Guru Rinpoche really coming or not?&rdquo; or\n          &ldquo;Really, how do I know?&rdquo;... and with this kind of dubious\n          mind, then the blessings are not able to enter. So have one-pointed\n          conviction. Have conviction beyond any shadow of a doubt. Do not let\n          doubt enter. When you do not have doubt and when you have confidence\n          and trust, then the blessings can really enter you. Then it is certain\n          that you will get the blessing.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"c0 c2\"></p>\n        <p>\n          And so that being said, then thinking of all of the beings of the six\n          realms, the six classes of migration, and the suffering of all of\n          these realms, the suffering of hell beings of intense hot and cold,\n          the suffering of hungry ghosts, preta beings, of intense hunger and\n          thirst, the suffering of animals with subjugation and of predators,\n          the suffering of gods of falling transition and actually the dying\n          transition and falling into the lower realms, the suffering of the\n          asuras, the jealous god realms, the suffering of bickering and\n          fighting, the suffering of worldly beings who are in the human\n          realm... look at all of the worldly human beings. Human beings are\n          completely distracted, completely distracted with worldly life to the\n          point that they have no leisure time, no free time because\n          they&rsquo;re so busy, busy-busy and distracted in trying to attain\n          food, trying to help their family, trying to attain wealth, trying to\n          maintain and accomplish more samsara, more worldly activity. So they\n          have no time. They are completely and utterly enraptured in the world,\n          in the worldly phenomena. For all of these beings in the six realms\n          who are completely filled with suffering, then one feels... From the\n          bottom of one&rsquo;s heart, one is praying to Guru Rinpoche saying,\n          &ldquo;Guru Rinpoche, please be aware of me. Please heed me. You know.\n          You know all us beings in the three realms of samsara. For all of us\n          we have no other protector, no other refuge besides you. Please, Guru\n          Rinpoche, please grant us your protection.&rdquo;\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And feeling in this way, this will give rise to a sort of solemn\n          longing, like almost like a sadness. And that will be so powerful,\n          such a powerful faith it should evoke tears in your eyes and goose\n          bumps. And when Guru Rinpoche himself said that as you&rsquo;re\n          praying and supplicating him single-pointedly with this almost like\n          mournful kind of longing like a sorrow and faith and longing, then\n          when these tears start to stream down your cheeks, then Guru Rinpoche\n          himself has it said in writing, &ldquo;For each tear that falls down\n          your cheek, this is more and more of your sins and obscurations are\n          being purified and cleansed away.&rdquo; And so for every tear, you\n          are purifying an inconceivable amount of negative karma and\n          obscurations. And so when you have this kind of intense, overpowering,\n          completely single-pointed faith and longing that brings tears to your\n          eyes, then this is a sign that the blessings are entering into you.\n          And until you get to some of this feeling, then this is a sign that\n          the blessings are coming.\n        </p>\n        <p>Rinpoche speaks.</p>\n        <p>\n          And so at first it&rsquo;s very difficult to have this really deep,\n          deep kind of almost like a longing sadness, sorrowful faith, and\n          devotion that calls out to Guru Rinpoche to the point where it just\n          brings these tears to your eyes. That kind of real faith is very hard\n          to have in the very beginning. And so it&rsquo;s something you just\n          continue to develop. And then if you&rsquo;re able to, when you have\n          this kind of intense longing, that&rsquo;s almost like a sorrowful\n          faith and longing for Guru Rinpoche.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And when you do the Seven Line Prayer and invoke Guru Rinpoche on the\n          tenth day, Guru Rinpoche Day, or the twenty-fifth day, the Dakini Day,\n          and so forth, on these particular holy days when you invoke Guru\n          Rinpoche, then you will have signs of his blessings different and more\n          potent than before. And one of these signs is that you will find\n          suddenly that a new kind of disgust or sadness with samsara will\n          arise, and you will begin to see that samsara, the worldly dharma, has\n          no essence. And when you begin to see the essence-less pointlessness\n          of samsara, then this is a sign of the blessings of Guru Rinpoche\n          starting to enter into you. And likewise you will feel, even stronger\n          than ever before, a real urgency and desire to attain enlightenment.\n          And when that urgency comes, too, that really feels &ldquo;I must\n          attain awakening then, the same way,&rdquo; then this is a sign of\n          Guru Rinpoche&rsquo;s blessings entering into your mind stream. And so\n          when you get these tears that come, well up from deep from your heart\n          as you&rsquo;re supplicating Guru Rinpoche, then your mind will\n          change. Your mind starts to change. It becomes different. And this is\n          almost like a sadness, like a gentle, tender longing. And this is also\n          a sign of Guru Rinpoche&rsquo;s blessings actually touching you,\n          entering you when you have these tears come and this kind of intense\n          longing.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so in the beginning you will have the feeling that Guru Rinpoche\n          is somehow outside, out there... that Guru Rinpoche is outwardly\n          present before you. Eventually, however, if you continue, you will\n          realize that, &ldquo;Oh, my mind and Guru Rinpoche, there&rsquo;s no\n          difference!&rdquo; And then you will say, &ldquo;Oh, the very essence\n          of my mind is in fact Guru Rinpoche.&rdquo; And then when you start to\n          realize that Guru Rinpoche abides within and is not out there, but\n          he&rsquo;s actually the very nature of your mind, then you have really\n          gotten... you&rsquo;ve developed along. So in the beginning now, yes,\n          Guru Rinpoche is outside. He&rsquo;s there external. But eventually\n          then you will see Guru Rinpoche to be within.\n        </p>\n        <p>Rinpoche speaks.</p>\n        <p>\n          So that&rsquo;s good that you&rsquo;re crying. It means you&rsquo;re\n          moved by this.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          So then all of you do not slack on the Seven Line Prayer. You should\n          make this your primary, main practice for your dharma center. Or your\n          dharma center, it should be your main practice. So you should make\n          this the principle practice for your center, the Seven Line Prayer.\n          Vajra Guru Mantra should be really our main center&rsquo;s practice,\n          what you are striving... And do not miss or skip the ganachakra\n          offering feasts for the tenth and the twenty-fifth day, that is Guru\n          Rinpoche Day, the tenth, and then the twenty-fifth, Dakini Day. So\n          make sure that you offer a tsok on these days. Now you don&rsquo;t\n          have to make it too elaborate because the more you have to do, then\n          the easier it is to skip it. So it&rsquo;s better that you have less,\n          but you do a nice job. And so try to collect a little bit\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Teachings on the Seven Line Prayer &mdash; Yangthang Tulku &mdash;\n          Santa Monica, December 9, 2006 &ndash; 17 of 21 &ndash;\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"c0 c2\"></p>\n        <p>\n          of money, one dollar here, five dollars here, from everybody, and buy\n          a nice bunch of offerings for the tsok. And then arrange it very\n          nicely and neatly &mdash; very pleasing offerings that delight the\n          mind, that are pleasing, that you enjoy. Likewise when you set up your\n          shrine and you set up the tsok and you&rsquo;re arranging the tsok\n          offering and the substances, don&rsquo;t do it in a sloppy manner, but\n          do it in a very beautiful and pristine, pleasant manner that delights\n          the mind. This is another profound way of accumulating merit,\n          gathering accumulation. And if you want to offer incense, offer it\n          nicely. If you want to offer flowers, offer nice beautiful pleasing\n          flowers and something that really pleases the mind. If you don&rsquo;t\n          have a lot to offer, that&rsquo;s okay. Whatever you have, you offer\n          it nicely and pristinely. And you do so... you have the understanding\n          that this is a representational physical offering, but along with it\n          feel that you are offering all of the substances of enjoyment, all of\n          the enjoyments and possessions of all of the three realms in the\n          worldly... of the gods and humans of the three realms, and that these\n          are all arranged as a pleasing offering.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And then you arrange the tsok and you do the recitation of the verses\n          in accordance with the visualization as it is explained. And then you\n          recite the invocation, the Seven Line Prayer &mdash; accumulate that.\n          Then you go through the actual sadhana itself, go through the tsok\n          offering sadhana, offer the tsok, the confession, do the liberation\n          and all the stages of the traditional ganachakra. And then when you\n          finish that, then you can enjoy, partake in the siddhis in the tsok.\n          And so this tsok or ganachakra is a very special and extraordinary\n          means for gathering your accumulations. So when you talk about\n          gathering accumulations and purifying obscurations, then the tsok\n          offering is a supreme means, a very unusual and extraordinary means of\n          gathering accumulations. And so try not to really skip or forget to do\n          the tsok ganachakra offerings on the tenth lunar day and the\n          twenty-fifth lunar day. Maintain that uninterruptedly.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And even though in this particular sadhana, Shower of Blessings, there\n          is no remainders, there&rsquo;s no part for the remainders, but you\n          can actually take it from another sadhana or liturgy if you want to do\n          remainders, if you want to do the section of remainders that generally\n          goes in tsok. Of course, if you choose not to do it, there is no\n          contradiction. There is no transgression in itself. But it&rsquo;s\n          always nice to offer the remainders if you want to take it from\n          another liturgy and kind of supplement it with this tsok within the\n          Shower of Blessings tsok because in this way the remainders help you\n          to... To those who do not have the fortune to partake in the actual\n          first portion, then you are sort of... The blessings of Guru Rinpoche\n          are being shared with the beings and protectors and\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Teachings on the Seven Line Prayer &mdash; Yangthang Tulku &mdash;\n          Santa Monica, December 9, 2006 &ndash; 18 of 21 &ndash;\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"c0 c2\"></p>\n        <p>\n          so forth who do not have the opportunity to partake in the actual\n          first portion. So it&rsquo;s good to offer the remainders. And so if\n          you&rsquo;re able to offer the tsok in this way, then that&rsquo;s\n          very good.\n        </p>\n        <p>Rinpoche speaks.</p>\n        <p>\n          And so then henceforth if you are able in your dharma center really\n          for each and every person to maintain practice of the Seven Line\n          Invocation Invitation Prayer to Guru Rinpoche, if each individual\n          isn&rsquo;t able to on their own accumulate a great deal, then at\n          least if one or two people can take on accumulating 100,000 Seven Line\n          Prayers, this would be of great benefit. However many you can recite,\n          then there&rsquo;s more benefit. So really it&rsquo;s just a plus.\n          It&rsquo;s more of a benefit to however much... if you want to do\n          100,000 or 200,000, however many you can recite to that extent,\n          there&rsquo;s more benefit in it. If everybody is able to do 100,000\n          Seven Line Prayers and then on top of that 100,000 Vajra Guru Mantras,\n          then this would be extremely good, extremely good.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so also henceforth if you are able, it would be very good if you\n          are able to really maintain the commitment of keeping ganachakra feast\n          offerings for the tenth and the twenty-fifth lunar days of every\n          month. And so if you are not able to make it for the tsok, then at\n          least on these days really remember to maintain... to recite the Seven\n          Line Prayer and the Vajra Guru Mantra because of course you do the\n          tsok whenever you can. Whenever you have free time, you should strive\n          in accumulating Seven Line Prayer and Vajra Guru. But for you, really,\n          if the tsok doesn&rsquo;t fall on a Sunday or a Saturday, then\n          it&rsquo;s pretty difficult to say whether you&rsquo;ll be able to\n          give tsok. But maybe you can do it early in the morning or in the\n          evening time on those days. And then if it happens that the tenth or\n          the twenty-fifth day fortunately falls on a weekend, then you can do\n          it during the day in the sun. But otherwise then try to at least\n          maintain... you know the dharma centers, they do drupchen, which is\n          daily extensive accumulation practices of sadhanas and so forth. If\n          it&rsquo;s difficult to be able to maintain really for most centers\n          this kind of extensive accomplishment practices over a period of days,\n          so as your extensive accomplishment practice, you should maintain\n          ongoing recitations of the Seven Line Invocation, the Tsigdun\n          [Jen-Dren???]. And each one should make this almost like your ongoing\n          continual practice, like the stream or continuum of your own\n          supplication.\n        </p>\n        <p>Rinpoche speaks.</p>\n        <p>\n          So whenever you&rsquo;re reciting the Vajra Guru Mantra or the Seven\n          Line Prayer, in either or both cases, you should visualize Guru\n          Rinpoche actually present there in the sky in front. Visualize\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Teachings on the Seven Line Prayer &mdash; Yangthang Tulku &mdash;\n          Santa Monica, December 9, 2006 &ndash; 19 of 21 &ndash;\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"c0 c2\"></p>\n        <p>\n          him there atop a lotus flower amid a lake with water of the eight\n          properties, Guru Rinpoche in union with mother consort, and feel that\n          he is completely surrounded by all of the rigzins, the vidyadharas,\n          the intrinsic awareness holding masters of India and Tibet, all of the\n          awakened ones without exception. If you are able to visualize each and\n          every one clearly, that&rsquo;s great. But even if not, just have the\n          understanding that they are all there present before you in the center\n          of Guru Rinpoche&rsquo;s union with consort. And if you&rsquo;re able\n          to visualize distinctly Guru Rinpoche&rsquo;s clothing and so forth,\n          then this is great. So then when you&rsquo;re doing the visualization,\n          then Guru Rinpoche is actually there present before you in the sky in\n          front and you recite the Tsigdun [Jen-Drun???] or the invocation\n          invitation with the Seven Line Prayer to Guru Rinpoche. And then when\n          you have finished accumulating your requisite number of Seven Line\n          recitations, feel that light rays emanate out from Guru\n          Rinpoche&rsquo;s body and enter into you and that when they touch you\n          feel that your mind stream is blessed and penetrated by the blessings\n          and compassion of Guru Rinpoche. And now then you go ahead and you\n          perform your tsok, your offering, and then finally feel that... At the\n          end feel that from the three or five places of Guru Rinpoche, from the\n          five places (in his forehead, throat, heart, navel, and secret center)\n          emanate out, radiate out five colored rays of light, which enter into\n          your five places. First you feel that your body, speech, and mind are\n          completely purified of all of their sins and obscurations. And finally\n          when the fourth light comes from the navel center... So white light\n          from the forehead, red from the throat, blue from the heart, yellow\n          from the navel. And if you do it (five-place visualization),\n          it&rsquo;s green from the secret center. And then when light rays\n          emanate out a fourth time, feel that this purifies all the subtle and\n          course obscurations without exception. And finally Guru Rinpoche\n          dissolves into oneself. And at this point the mind of Guru Rinpoche\n          and your mind... your body and speech and mind meld inseparably.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          At this point you rest your mind in a state without anything to focus\n          on, without any focal point, without any objective reference. So in a\n          non-referential state you rest you mind naturally in its own state.\n          And so in this state you reside as long as you can &mdash; five or six\n          minutes in this state of resting your mind in its true nature. And so\n          this is a state... there&rsquo;s nothing to look at. There&rsquo;s\n          nothing outside. You turn... The mind turns in on itself and observes\n          itself at this point. Then you are resting your mind in its natural\n          state. This is known as the meditation or the resting in equipoise.\n          And this you will come to know. So do not worry if you don&rsquo;t\n          know it. If you want to know what equipoise and resting you remind in\n          its original state is, eventually this will become apparent to you.\n          You will come to know it. And so then you rest your mind in this\n          samadhi state of absorption. And\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Teachings on the Seven Line Prayer &mdash; Yangthang Tulku &mdash;\n          Santa Monica, December 9, 2006 &ndash; 20 of 21 &ndash;\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"c0 c2\"></p>\n        <p>\n          then finally you arrive from the samadhi. You reemerge. And then at\n          that moment you immediately think all phenomena are the nature,\n          emptiness, not anywhere really existent in and of themselves. They\n          have no inherent existence. All phenomena is empty.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And then again give rise to the compassion for all sentient beings and\n          dedicate your roots of virtue accumulated. And so your dedication\n          should be for the temporary and ultimate benefit and happiness of\n          oneself and boundless sentient beings. So you dedicate your merit so\n          that temporarily in the interim &ldquo;May all beings be free from\n          illness. May they have long life. May they be happy. May they\n          accomplish their wishes and aims. And ultimately may they all attain\n          buddhahood.&rdquo; And so to this you dedicate your merit. And if you\n          are able to do this and all practices in this way, by dedicating the\n          merit properly in the end and so forth and maintain really continually\n          this practice, then it would be of much benefit.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And I have nothing else to say but that. Today is perfectly\n          accomplished.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Teachings on the Seven Line Prayer &mdash; Yangthang Tulku &mdash;\n          Santa Monica, December 9, 2006\n        </p>\n      </Container>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default YangthangTulku;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport Container from \"react-bootstrap/Container\";\n\nimport * as S from \"./styles\";\n\nfunction LamaSangdu() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Container>\n        <S.TeachingsHeader>\n          ༄༅།\n          །བླ་མ་གསང་འདུས་ལས་གསུངས་པའི་ཁྱད་པར་བླ་སྒྲུབ་ཚིག་བདུན་གསོལ་འདེབས་བཞུགས།\n          Accomplishing the Lama through the Seven Line Prayer: A Special\n          Teaching from the Lama Sangdü\n        </S.TeachingsHeader>\n\n        <p>The terma revelation of Guru Chöwang</p>\n        <p>ཐུགས་དམ་ལྷ་ལ་ཕྱག་འཚལ་ལོ༔</p>\n        <p>Homage to the yidam deity!</p>\n        <p>\n          ཕྱི་རབས་སྐལ་ལྡན་རིགས་ཀྱི་བུ༔ ཨོ་རྒྱན་བདག་ལ་སྐྱབས་འཚོལ་ན༔\n          དབེན་པའི་གནས་སུ་རང་འདུག་ནས༔ མི་རྟག་སྐྱོ་བ་སྐྱེ་བ་དང་༔\n          འཁོར་བས་སུན་པ་རབ་ཏུ་གཅེས༔\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Fortunate men and women of the future, sons and daughters of an\n          enlightened family, when you turn to me, the Guru of Orgyen, for\n          refuge, take yourself to an isolated place, and make deep feelings\n          arise of melancholy at impermanence, and disgust with saṃsāra—this is\n          vital.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          བློ་སྙིང་བྲང་གསུམ་ང་ལ་གཏོད༔ གཞན་ཡང་སྐྱབས་གྱུར་རེ་ས་རྣམས༔\n          ཨོ་རྒྱན་བདག་ལ་རྫོགས་པར་སོམས༔ སྐྱིད་སྡུག་རེ་ལྟོས་ཁྱེད་ཤེས་ཀྱིས༔\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Then rely on me completely, heart and soul.
