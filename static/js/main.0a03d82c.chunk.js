And so this is a supplication, a prayer to Guru Rinpoche, an invitation bringing forth, inviting Guru Rinpoche. And so really in terms of a very good, extensive explanation on this, I do not have one to give. But Mipham Rinpoche himself composed a very extensive commentary on the Seven Line Prayer \u2014 50 pages of outer, inner, secret, and super-secret explanations from the point of these four levels or sections.

But Guru Rinpoche doesn\u2019t have to come and go like an ordinary person. However, spontaneously and naturally he makes his presence known. So he actually appears there in the context and the presence of the feast when the dakinis and mamos are then reciting this Seven Line Invitation, this supplication to Guru Rinpoche.

And there were the heretic groups who wished to, by means of debate, win over the institute and take it over under the context of their rule. And so they challenged the Buddhist panditas left in this institute to a debate. And because these were great scholars, great masters, they didn\u2019t really know how to respond.

And Guru Rinpoche did actually appear there. He actually came. And when he came, then he went ahead and helped them. He defeated all of the heretic groups.

So \u201cIn the northwest corner in the country of Orgyen in the pollen heart of a lotus...\u201d And the pollen heart of the lotus literally is described to be geographically over the residence where the King Jokpo of the nagas resides."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"And so then Guru Rinpoche born there in the pollen heart of this lotus flower... Then the way this occurred is that in the western pure land, the Lord Protector Buddha Amitabha emanated out rays of red light or emanated out a red HRI syllable from his heart and rays of red light, which then manifested a lotus flower in the center of which is like the very pollen heart, like the pistil of the lotus flower. And in the pollen heart of this lotus flower, then the great illustrious Avolokitesvara, Chenrezig, then came and blessed the lotus flower. And there arose the emanation of Guru Rinpoche. And so then Guru Rinpoche took birth there upon this lotus flower."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"And calling the land of Uddiyana somewhere in Pakistan is not saying it\u2019s exactly down there on the map, but that it\u2019s somewhere in this general area. And the reason it is called \u201cOrgyen yul\u201d or the Land of Orgyen, the Land of Uddiyana, is because this was the name of the place when Indrabodhi, the king, was there in reign. And this is where he went when he found Guru Rinpoche there and brought him back, and invited him to take over the kingdom, invited him to the kingdom as the prince. And so that is why it is called the Land of Orgyen. This is the area in which he was invited \u2014 the empire."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"So most of you probably already know this story. And so I\u2019m thinking, you know, most of you have already heard this and are familiar with it... the story of how actually King Indrabodhi came to find Guru Rinpoche and invite him back to the palace. But even if you already know it, I\u2019m thinking that it\u2019s better that I do say it anyway. It would be better to do that because otherwise it\u2019d be like we\u2019re leaving out a very important part of the story, kind of skipping over an important segment. So then I will say it in any case."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"And the story of King Indrabodhi, just in brief, is that the king was incredibly powerful, had incredible sovereignty, and was incredibly wealthy. And yet he could not seem to produce an heir. He could not give birth to a son. And so this going on for a long time, he realized that he needed to do something about this. And so he went to consult with every single divination master in the land, every single astrologer in the land, and asking all the diviners and astrologers what they saw that he could do in order to produce an heir, to actually produce a son. Then all of them said one thing, \u201cYou must give all of your wealth to the poor, you must give all of your wealth to the needy, and you need to accumulate merit. So if you gather accumulations by practicing generosity, giving everything you have, whatever you can, to the needy and the poor, then you will be able to have a son.\u201d And so then he also went to those who had psychic powers, a clairvoyance, and they said the same thing. So every single one who did divinations and everyone who did astrology, all the masters who had clairvoyance, they all said with a single voice, \u201cYou must do this. Give everything you have to the poor and to the village.\u201d"),o.a.createElement("p",null,"And so this is what he did. Because he was extremely wealthy, he had many treasuries of wealth. He had incredible gold storehouses, storehouses filled with gold and jewels and turquoise and the finest, finest foods and so forth, the finest raiment. He had storehouses of everything imaginable in his vast kingdom. And so in accordance with the suggestions of all of these diviners and astrologers, then he went and opened up all of storehouses and he basically just said, \u201cCome forth!\u201d to all the of beggars. He just said \u201cCome, all of you!\u201d He opened his doors for all of the poor to just come and take whatever they wanted. And so what he did was he simply offered whatever the person needed, whether the person wanted clothes or the person needed food or they wanted money and wealth, whatever it was. And he would give it like a wish-fulfilling jewel from his treasuries. And so this he continued to do to hundreds of thousands of beggars and poor."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"And so this went on for many years until eventually his vast storehouses were emptied and all of his wealth was exhausted. But still more beggars continued to come. And so feeling forlorn and frustrated, he went to consult his ministers because he felt that, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t turn these people away, but I have nothing left. I\u2019ve given everything I have. And so now I still don\u2019t have a son. And it seems that all of this was just pointless. And now I\u2019ve lost everything that I have.\u201d And so being in this state of being disheartened, he consulted with all of his ministers, and they were pretty much equally confused. They didn\u2019t really have a good answer, and all they could say was, \u201cWell, there\u2019s only one option left, you know. On the other side of the vast lake, there is rumored to be a wish- fulfilling jewel. And this wish-fulfilling jewel, if you\u2019re able to obtain it at great cost, then once it\u2019s in your hands whatever you wish for will be spontaneously granted. And so immediately the king devised a plan to be able to go and actually find this wish-fulfilling jewel.

And there have been many, many journeyers, many who have tried to go in the past. And not a single one has returned because they have either been attacked by the wild serpent spirit being in the water, or they have just been attacked by all of the dangers along the way on the perilous journey. So it\u2019s extremely difficult to actually make it there. And so it\u2019s best that you do not attempt that and thus risk your life.\u201d But the king was adamant and he wasn\u2019t going to listen to them."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"And so he announced to all of the subjects in the kingdom and tried to find anyone who could say that they\u2019ve at least made that journey and come back to tell about it.

By now his hair was white and he was seeped in old age, but he was the only one who had ever been, who knew the way, who knew how to lead someone there. And so he reluctantly told the king that, yes, he had been there. And the king then asked him if he would be his boatman and ferry him across the water. And the old man became very frightened, and he really tried to dissuade the king from making him do this. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous.\u201d And what he was thinking was, \u201cYou\u2019re the king. You\u2019re the most powerful and important man in the kingdom.

So the king tried to reassure him saying, \u201cOkay, as long as you just do the job of carrying me across the water... Tell me everything we need. I will make all the preparations from my side. And then you just be the one to lead us, to take us along the water in the boat.\u201d And so the old boatman then gave him all the instructions of preparations needed to be made. And [he said], \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll need this and you\u2019ll need this kind of thing.

And finally they were getting closer and closer to their destination, to the island where the jewel resided. And so the old man was the only one who was able to determine, who knew where the land would be and what it looked like and how to recognize it."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"Now also another aspect of this story is that the king was blind. He didn\u2019t have working vision. But yet as a sign of the blessings of this wish-fulfilling jewel, then even by coming into the vicinity of the jewel, then one of his eyes restored its eyesight. And so all of the a sudden the king was pointing at all of the different colored mountains \u2014 the white, the yellow, and all of these different mountain ranges that he could see on the horizon they were coming to approach. And his retinue was absolutely flabbergasted and they said, \u201cHow is it that you can see this?\u201d And he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My vision in this one eye...\u201d One of his eyes had been restored to vision."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"And so then the old man finally found the exact land and where they had to go. And so he said, \u201cOkay, now the rest of you wait. The only one who can go to find this jewel has to have incredible merit, really be a lucky person with good merit because there are many wild animals. It\u2019s extremely dangerous, extremely perilous along this area, so the only one who can really come must have tremendous merit. So saying this, then the king said, \u201cOkay, well, I will go.\u201d"),o.a.createElement("p",null,"And they went to this place where the old man led them and then they found this one structure like a building or a house.

And when she appears, she will give you this wish-fulfilling jewel. But do not mistake it. Do not go about picking up another ordinary jewel and taking it back with you without recognizing the wish-fulfilling jewel.\u201d And so doing as they were instructed, then when the girl came and they actually got the wish-fulfilling jewel then they felt a little bit relieved. So now they could go ahead and they were told that, \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to pick up other jewels if you want because now you have the wish-fulfilling jewel.

His treasurer was like a merchant who acted as the king\u2019s treasurer, one of his attendants.

And also it was extremely beautiful and it was encased and showering, emanating out all of these rainbows and light rays. So it was inconceivably different than the others. And seeing this kind of stupendous, unbelievable sight, then the treasurer went to go and tell the king that something unusual is here. This flower isn\u2019t like all of the others. And in addition to that, then when he went to look back before he went to go and tell the king what he found, then the flower began to open. The lotus flower opened up and there in the center was an extremely beautiful, young boy, like a magical boy who then took this miraculous birth in the center of this flower."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"So then knowing that the king was on his way back, then the treasurer went to go and tell the king to come and look at this to see what it could be.

Look at this incredible lotus flower with all of these light rays.\u201d And the treasurer was surprised. He said, \u201cYou can see that?!\u201d And the king said, \u201cYes, because now due to the power of the blessings...\u201d First he got one eyesight restored, and now again due to the blessings of Guru Rinpoche and the birth of Guru Rinpoche now both of his eyes were restored to vision and he was able to behold everything perfectly.

And so for that then he had been able to behold all of this incredible sight. And there before him Guru Rinpoche in the form of this young boy was there in the center of this miraculous lotus flower.

I\u2019m bringing the heir to the throne, a prince, here.

So praying, supplicating the jewel, then all of his treasuries and storehouses that had been emptied were filled again. And now he could give to the poor like never before.

Without renouncing the worldly samsara, you will not be able to benefit beings. Thus now time has come to renounce the kingdom and to go on your way to further your enactment of enlightened activities for the benefit of beings.\u201d And so seeing this, then Guru Rinpoche knew that he would have to renounce the kingdom by using skillful means, some kind of strategy. He would not be able to just simply leave. There would have to be a way that would allow him to leave the kingdom in a way that would work. And so then he devised a plan."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"Of course there are many different explanations and accounts of this, but this is one story, one account. And so he went to the top of the roof and he brought his staff, like his khatvanga or his staff. And holding his staff over the top of the roof of the castle then he dropped it. He let it drop so that it landed on a mara demon, which actually destroyed the demon, liberating him. But at the same time it broke a major law because here he was basically committing the act of killing and dropping his staff. And so as he had broken one of the major laws of the kingdom, that he himself was no exception, he also had to fall under the perjury [sic] of the law. And so then all of the ministers and all of the king... the father and the queen, the king and the queen, they all came to figure out what the right course of action would be. And of course they didn\u2019t want him to leave. But there was either the choice of he was to be executed or sometime terrible, some horrible punishment, or he was to be ostracized and simply excommunicated, made to leave to the far, far reaches of the borderland somewhere. And so because they couldn\u2019t bear the idea of him being executed, then they banished him to the far outskirts of this area, which was extremely dangerous. It was like a charnel ground area. But actually this was perfect for Guru Rinpoche. He accomplished his intention. And so now he freely left the kingdom then."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"And so this is how he was able to skillfully renounce the kingdom and then go. And this is where there are many, many accounts of Guru Rinpoche and how he lived, enacted his enlightened activities throughout the fearful charnel grounds. And in this way then this is how through skillful means he was able to escape or renounce the kingdom. Now then there are further accounts of how he went to India and manifested the attainment of all of the siddhis and accomplishments, and then how he tamed countless beings and nestled them into the dharma and liberated them through dharma."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"And then finally he actually returned to the Land of Orgyen, the kingdom of Indrabodhi.

So then after everyone attained rainbow body, it was like it was just left abandoned. There was nobody left."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"And so this is the story of how Guru Rinpoche\u2019s... and this is why it is the first of the Seven Line Prayer \u201cIn the country of Orgyen\u201d \u2014 because Orgyen was where he came, where he was invited, where he demonstrated the activity of renouncing samsara, renouncing the kingdom. And it\u2019s also where he returned later to turn the wheel of dharma and where he ended up nestling all of the subjects and all of the residents of Orgyen there into the dharma, and thus emptying the entire kingdom because they all attained liberation, rainbow body."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"And so then Guru Rinpoche displayed unimaginable, inconceivable enlightened activities for the sake of the Buddha\u2019s teachings throughout India and Tibet. And so part of the story of the life of Guru Rinpoche is how he was, on more than one occasion, placed in situations in which he was almost... there were attempted assassinations. That is to say, he was tempted [sic] to be burnt alive on a pyre. And so the first time this happened was in Zahor and the second time was also in the Land of Orgyen because don\u2019t forget that he himself had made himself so that he was banished from the Kingdom of Orgyen. So when he came back, there were many who still had a lot of skepticism and doubt. And so then there was an attempt on his life to try and burn him alive in this giant pyre, this giant fire, cremation fire. But then displaying countless miraculous activities, then... In this case he had transformed the fire into a lake and then people found him standing there in the midst of this self-arising lotus flower. And so seeing this, then people had tremendous faith and devotion arise for him. And it is in this way that he tamed the minds of countless beings (through displaying miraculous activities) and turned their minds to the dharma."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"Now there are some places you can actually visit. In terms of where he was exactly where he had transformed this fire into a lake, it used to be that it was surrounded by some mountain regions and you could visit it. But then there was a tremendous earthquake and so now you can\u2019t see any more this exact area, so it\u2019s not visible. But what is visible, what you can still see is you can go to actually the Land of Orgyen to the very lake. And you can actually see the lake where it is said that the lotus flower self-arose and there arose Guru Rinpoche. So this is something that you can all actually see directly with your own eyes, this very area and lake. And so this is the meaning of these two lines \u201cOn the northwest corner of the country of Orgyen in the pollen heart of a lotus.\u201d"),o.a.createElement("p",null,"\u201cYou attained marvelous, miraculous siddhis\u201d is the third line \u201cyatsen chokgi ngodrup nyay.\u201d And so what this means is that he demonstrated the attainment of the supreme and the common siddhis, spiritual attainments.

So you will find the Seven Line Prayer in all of these termas, the treasures. And so it is... Of all of the prayers of supplication to Guru Rinpoche, this one has the most blessings and the most potency. There are many different supplication prayers of Guru Rinpoche, but none has more blessings, none is as all-encompassing as the Seven Line Prayer.

Like for example whenever we recite this prayer, also as the Vajra Seven Line Invocation or Invitation, we are actually inviting Guru Rinpoche, supplicating him to bless our mind streams. And if you maintain this, if you really focus on the Seven Line Prayer, then it is certain that the blessings will come. The blessings of Guru Rinpoche will spring out and be born in your mind stream. And so there\u2019s tremendous blessings of this practice. And that is why we actually say in the verse \u201cchingyi lap-chir sheksu sol,\u201d \u201cPlease, Guru Rinpoche, come in order to bestow blessings.\u201d And so it\u2019s actually in the words, the supplication.

And so if you are able to do this, a good kind of sadhana or practice in which you can practice and accumulate the Seven Line Prayer is by Mipham Rinpoche \u2014 the Shower of Blessings practice by Mipham Rinpoche, which is concise, condensed. It\u2019s not too much. Because if it\u2019s too much, then it becomes a problem for us because we just have too much to recite. But then if it\u2019s too short then that\u2019s also a problem. This is just the right length. It\u2019s nice and concise and not too long, not too many words. And so if you can all practice in the context of the Seven Line Prayer, then there is great benefit in this. And particularly also, when you do your tsok, your ganachakra feast offerings, this also has a very short one-page tsok offering. So you can also accumulate your ganachakra feast in the context of the sadhana of the Seven Line Invocation of Guru Rinpoche. And if you want to practice this together, recite it together in a group, that\u2019s great. And also you can do it on your own as your own individual practice using the Shower of Blessings. And so it\u2019s very good if you can do the offerings of the tsok and ganachakra in the context of this practice. I don\u2019t know if you have this text or not, but it is available in English, so it would be good to recite that."),o.a.createElement("p",{class:"c0 c2"}),o.a.createElement("p",null,"Now most importantly when you recite the Seven Line Invitation Invocation of Guru Rinpoche, the most important thing depends upon your faith. You have to have the faith which is known... the faith of absolute confidence of the presence of Guru Rinpoche, which is often known as the faith of surrender, the faith that you know, the faith that feels that \u201cWhether I am high or low, whatever position I am in, wherever I am and whatever my circumstance, Guru Rinpoche, you know me. You are aware of me.\u201d And that kind of heart-felt confidence and faith, the trust that surrenders to Guru Rinpoche, is known as the faith of utter surrender, the utter trusting faith. And when that kind of faith arises from the bottom of your heart, then anybody can assert, can confidently tell you, \u201cYes, the blessings will definitely enter into your mind stream.\u201d But without faith, then even if you go through many recitations with your mouth of the Seven Line Prayer, there\u2019s no certainty that the blessings will enter. Why? Because the doorway to the blessings entering depends upon your faith and devotion. And so when your own faith and devotion in Guru Rinpoche meets with the innate blessings of the Seven Line Prayer, when these two factors come into confluence, then there is blessings. Then the blessings can actually penetrate. But you need to have one-pointed faith and devotion, single-pointed.

Out of these four types of faith, the most important types are the faith of confidence, otherwise known as the faith of trust, and the faith that is irreversible, the faith that will never turn back.
